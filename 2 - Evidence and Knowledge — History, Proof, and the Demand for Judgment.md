^bd5b1a

- case discussed in *Dead Certainties*
- prof. of chemistry convicted for the murder of Dr. Parkman
	- step through the facts — more detailed than in Psalgraf, discusses people more
- uses evidence from dentists and his artificial teeth
- murder on the 23rd, arrested on 30th, indicted in january of 1850
### majority opinion
- by justice shaw
- explains the "degrees" and varieties of manslaughter
	- turns to common law — adopted by *general consent*
	- still practices
- but in statue law is expanded into murder and manslaughter 
	- murder: killing with *malice aforethought*, express or implied 
		- regardless of how "sudden" everything was
	-  manslaughter: killing without malice
		- from this, can be voluntary (real design and purpose, but occasioned by sudden passion)
			- law forgives due to "tenderness for the frailty of human nature"
		- or involuntary, when death is caused by some other unlawful act not designed to take a life
	- so key diff is malice: 
		- but need legal character and the evidence needed 
- words aren't enough to justify malice 
- the issue with passion: man is "bound" to curb passions — killing even due to passion is still criminal and manslaughter
- "malice aforethought" does not mean a long time from conception to commitment; rather, it's *purpose and design, in contradistinction to accident and mischance*
- homicide in mutual combat is also an exception — not excusable, but not full murder
- discusses all this before *actually getting to the case itself*
- also makes the distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence...
	- direct is preferred, but with only direct nothing would get done, circumstantial is necessary
- in homicide, must demonstrate it is death by violence AND not self-inflicted
	- must be proven *beyond a reasonable doubt*
- which is moral certainty on the part of the jury
	- burden of evidence on prosecutor, innocent until proven guilty 
	- "reasonable and moral certainty; a certainty that convinces and directs the understanding, and satisfied the reason and judgement of those who are bound to act conscientiously upon it."
- law as relying on moral nature
- after conviction and sentencing (hanging), dr webster confesses!
## **Schama, Dead Certainties**

^2d290e

- kinda like passengers of psalgraf vs. the case, showing "another way" of knowing and telling the story
- jumps between perspectives each chapter 
	- goes chronologically
	- but both uses first and third person, changes even mid-chapter depending? 
		- but always omniscient
### afterword: 
- afterword gives some more meta commentary on history and historians
	- how to bring the past into the present? 
		- living in two worlds: documented past and EITHER restore it to life or give it a decent interment 
- historians can never tell a full story
	- in the book, play with the "gap separating a lived event and its subsequent narration"
		- and schama clarifies they're works of imagination, not scholarship 
- and the intentionality of the style — showing the difficulty/confusion of trying to write/narrate painful histories?
	- the multiple possibilities are left — how Parkman actually died is still unclear 
	- discusses where the remains of Parkman and Webster are, and the difference in location
- some parts are historical inventions, but based on real events/evidence
- but doesn't say the lived past is *nothing* more than an artificially designed text
- also: the publicity of it — how the dead bodies became public posessions 
- perhaps just shadows of this world are enough....
## [[Herrera v Texas.pdf]]

^7e0637

Herrera v. Collins - 506 U.S. 390, 113 S. Ct. 853 (1993)
### RULE:
A petitioner otherwise subject to defenses of abusive or successive use of the writ may have his federal constitutional claim considered on the merits if he makes a proper showing of actual innocence. This rule, or fundamental miscarriage of justice exception, is grounded in the "equitable discretion" of habeas courts to see that federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarceration of innocent persons. But this body of habeas jurisprudence makes clear that a claim of "actual innocence" is not itself a constitutional claim, but instead a gateway through which a habeas petitioner must pass to have his otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on the merits.
### FACTS:
Herrera was convicted of the capital murder of Police Officer Carrisalez and sentenced to death in January 1982. The conviction was based on two eyewitness identifications, numerous pieces of circumstantial evidence and petitioner Herrera's handwritten letter impliedly admitting his guilt. In July 1982, Herrera pleaded guilty to the related capital murder of Officer Rucker. Herrera unsuccessfully challenged the Carrisalez conviction on direct appeal and in two collateral proceedings in the Texas state courts, and in a federal habeas petition. Ten years after his conviction, he urged in a second federal habeas proceeding that newly discovered evidence demonstrated that he was "actually innocent" of the murders of Carrisalez and Rucker and that his execution was prohibited by the [Eighth](https://advance.lexis.com/search/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=3d88bec5-8e25-4d95-b039-6a173432e0ac&pdsearchterms=Herrera+v.+Collins%2C+506+U.S.+390+(1993)&pdstartin=hlct%3A1%3A1&pdtypeofsearch=searchboxclick&pdsearchtype=SearchBox&pdqttype=and&pdquerytemplateid=&ecomp=v5q1k&prid=f02666ac-3f3b-4834-a47a-90e8d0d8aa4e) Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and that the [Fourteenth Amendment's](https://advance.lexis.com/search/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=3d88bec5-8e25-4d95-b039-6a173432e0ac&pdsearchterms=Herrera+v.+Collins%2C+506+U.S.+390+(1993)&pdstartin=hlct%3A1%3A1&pdtypeofsearch=searchboxclick&pdsearchtype=SearchBox&pdqttype=and&pdquerytemplateid=&ecomp=v5q1k&prid=f02666ac-3f3b-4834-a47a-90e8d0d8aa4e) due process guarantee. Herrera presented affidavits tending to show that his now-dead brother had committed the murders. The district court granted his request for a stay of execution so that he could present his actual innocence claim and the supporting affidavits in state court. In vacating the stay, the court of appeals held that the claim was not cognizable on federal habeas absent an accompanying federal constitutional violation.
### ISSUE:
Was Herrera entitled to federal habeas corpus relief?
### ANSWER:
No.
### CONCLUSION:
The Court held that Herrera's claim of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence was not a ground for federal habeas corpus relief absent an independent constitutional violation. According to the Court, the State met its burden of proving that the inmate was guilty of the capital murder beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. Thus, the inmate did not come before the courts as one who was "innocent," but as one who had been convicted by due process of law. The Court posited that Texas' refusal to entertain Herrera's newly discovered evidence eight years after his conviction did not transgress any principle of fundamental fairness.
