- basically, why do we follow precedent? what defines something as a precedent? 
- the treatment of event in X like Y in the past — only bc of that — means trading X with Y if X occurs again
	- not just a court thing — seen throughout law
- good quotes on the importance of precedence in life on pg 2? 
- must look at non-legal precedent to understand legal precedent 
### forward-looking aspect of precedent 
- actions today can be used as precedent in the future
- a balance of past and future 
- but must deal with past through decisionmaker's *words*
	- so need to disentangle effect of a past decision from the effect of words
		- what was *done* versus what was *said*
- example of the kid on p3
- the language as creating the rule! 
	- these future-focused arguments as very common! 
- but being constrained by precedent involves things outside of being constrained by specific normative language 
### isolating the argument from precedent 
- argument from precedent; argument from experience
	- i.e. a sentencing is an argument/experience, not a precedent 
- even if we think a past decision was wrong, the fact that it was decided before at all gives it value
- precedent as a *rule* of precedent — non-constraining
	- if seen as a rule, only think that matters is the result of the decisions, not on the validity 
- but the hierarchy of decisionmakers (aka courts) implicated "considerations different from those involved when a decisionmaker is constrained but its previous actions as opposed to the orders of its superiors in the hierarchy" — 6
	- so who wins? superior court of precedent
- but does precedent matter at all, and if so, how? 
### can precedent constrain?
- rules of relevance
	- looking back to see if a case is relevant — is X close enough to Y?
		- not all events are identical at all
	- an organization of *rules of relevance* can distinguish what is important 
		- existence of distinct principles show that things that once mattered don't anymore — i.e. race within a case
	- "Precedent depends on rules, and those rules themselves depend on context." — 8
	- assuming the case will be important in the future presupposes some kind of relevance
	- key issue is one of *assimilation* — how to group facts and events in the world
		- no matter how easy/hard, it is necessary for precedent at all
- categories of decision and categories of the world 
	- where do the rules allowing us to say X is close enough to Y come from? 
- **the articulated characterisation**
	- aka importance of language used 
	- distinctive characterisation can limit the use of future connections to a case
		- assumed to be "mere dicta," but doesn't want to turn to question of dicta and holdings 
	- thus, characterisation acts like a rule — rules can be broken, but justifying breaking it is much harder 
		- so, how much can this language constrain/limit? 
	- removing the characterisation makes precedent much clearer 
		- everything has characterisations in the world! 
			- when we worry about future applications of an event, usually due to a lack of authoritative characterisation separating things! 
	- so, if there is no characterisation, is precedent restraining at all? 
- **roots of characterisation**
	- for any decision, are there restraints on the categories of assimilation that let us link past to future? 
	- *naturalism:* language as only recognising existing categories
		- this is the more formalist category
			- formalist only asks if X and Y are similar, not how are why they are 
	- *nominalism:* subdivisions are artificial due to culture
		- more realist 
			- but this approach makes everything much weaker, easy to change 
			- so judges should make their cases for *today*
- these are caricatures, but useful 
	- formalism as better as describing immediate actions of individuals than nominalists! 
- again, categorisation is central to life! 
	- this isn't controversial, everyone does it! 
- if a category doesn't exist, much easier than when it does
- reliance on english categories, social and linguistic from the wider environment 
- everything about precedent just relies on categories! 
	- and constrains the context!
### the price of precedent
- the fact of precedent existing doesn't say anything about the desirability or degree of the constraints! 
- issue of judge ruling with precedent but against what he would have done
- precedent in this way is constraining from the past *and* present 
	- thinking of future decisions
		- so assuming the same event/category will be brought up again, question of what is best for *all* cases within the category is raised 
		- but without knowing the details
- does maths to prove it -- pg 19
- basically, must consider things that are broader than the one immediately 
	- so some cases won't be optimal to keep bad results in the future from happening — the **costs** of a precedential system! 
### the question of weight 
- level of constraint due to precedent varies with size of the category! 
	- amount of variation the decisionmaker has to acknowledge affects the strength 
		- if highly specific, precedent isn't super constraining, but if it is super general, way more constraining! 
	- close relation between them! 
- "binding" — similar to strength? 
	- either must be followed or distinguished 
- precedent as *presumptive*
	- gives weight without making it overly despotic 
	- precedent as a constraint/reason can be distinguished from precedent *fully* binding or constraining
- important: ability to distinguish covereage and protection, scope/strength — thus reasons as presumptive
	- so overriding events are measured along a *different* plane from the preceding one
		- precedent doesn't do this!
			- attaches to random constraints?
- decision to follow or not follow precedent isn't random — relies on similarity and difference! 
	- thus must be justified to not follow it 
- "weight" as misleading — binary result of followed or distinguished 
- but how to *describe* the past precedents and present events? 
	- harder to be more general about it 
	- so again, strength = size 
		- more general description means more strength in the precedent set? 
- so pros and cons — if precedent is a strong constraint, decisionmakers can ignore small but important differences
	- so why use it? 
### the virtues of precedential constraint
- so why use it? 
#### the argument from fairness
- key argument as "fairness" — treat the cases alike
- inconsistency is unequal, thus bad — consistency is needed for real equality!
	- again raising the question of what "alike" actually means
		- and again, wider definition = stronger precedent setting, narrower = less presence
- all again related back to the size!
#### the argument from predictability 
- also — ability to be able to predict what the decisionmaker will rule is important — stops us from having to foresee the unknown 
- predictability is desirable! 
- but precedential systems are ALWAYS somewhat suboptimal 
	- so how to find the balance? 
- large number of factors, seen above: size, likelihood, even changes based on current environment 
	- and the *frequency* of these suboptimal results:
> To take an extreme example, making all capital punishment decisions under a strict precedential rule would satisfy desires for predictability but would also entail putting to death some people who would live if their individual cases were scrutinized carefully. And, at the other extreme, many decisions involving the formalities of contracts or real estate transactions are decisions in which sacrificing optimality for predictability would involve negative consequences that are far from catastrophic.
- there's even variability in the value of the predictable! can't quantify it 
	- a psychological phenomenon, difficult to discuss, kind of like trauma!
- kind of like a cost-benefit analysis when thinking about predictability 
#### the argument from strengthened decisionmaking 
##### decisionmaking efficiency 
- precedent makes this more efficient — more precedent, less time the judge has to think
	- assumption that decision will/would be the same every time, even if the decisionmaker started over again! 
##### strengthening the decisionmaking institution
- consistency = more trust
	- minimising inconsistency makes people in general trust it and rely on it more! 
- plus, this also depends a lot on the context of the decisionmaking!
#### precedent and stability 
- many ways at looking at the issue — but there is some level of overlap
	- "But by viewing the issue in this was, we see that the various abstract and formal justifications for precedent all rest on conclusions about what ranges of events we wish to treat in like manner." — 31
- so many determining factors: culture, language, expectations, experience, legal structure, etc. 
	- so, which factor do we use? 
>  Without a universal answer to the question of whether stability is a good thing, we cannot decide whether decision according to precedent is a good thing. Stability may be unimpeachable in the abstract, but in reality stability comes only by giving up some of our flexibility to explore fully the deepest corners of the events now before us. Whether this price is worth paying will vary with the purposes to be served within a decisional domain, and we get no closer to knowing those purposes by understanding the relationship between stability and categorial size. Still, focusing on this relationship is valuable, because it enables us to see more clearly just how stability is achieved and just what kind of price we must pay to obtain it.
### conclusion: precedent and law
- modern legal theory wants to situate the phenomenon of law in the framework of politics 
	- differences are important, but also useful to *stress the similarities, to show the link between political state and a "private club"*, how the use and application of rules changes and are similar!
- so an implicit idea that theory of law must be limited to the government or certain system
	- nonleagal reasoning is in the courtroom, legal reasoning not in the courtroom 
- so do we design institutions based off of the system or vice versa? 
- a level of precedent does make us consider the decisions we make in more depth 
	- precedent as something flexible, can apply it to different contexts
- offers the idea of experimenting in different institutions, levels of risk, etc. — 34
	- and then use precedent when we need!

^406221

- question of belief in a living constitution asked constantly at confirmation hearings
- no set meaning, two key meanings:
	- Holmes version, from 1920:
		- When we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters. It was enough for them to realize or to hope that they had created an organism; it has taken a century and has cost their successors much sweat and blood to prove that they created a nation. -- 2
			- general language as left by the founders to allow the constitution to be applied to new environments:
				- "Merely because a particular activity may not have existed when the Constitution was adopted, or because the framers could not have conceived of a particular method of transacting affairs, cannot mean that general language in the Constitution may not be applied to such a course of conduct." — 2
	- "brief-writer's version: 
		- "Under this brief writer's version of the living Constitution, nonelected members of the federal judiciary may address themselves to a social problem simply because other branches of government have failed or refused to do so." — 3
- all about the issues about the second version: brief-writer's! 
- a suggested philosophical approach of judicial review
	- generally accepted that the "ideal" judicial review is antidemocratic! 
- example of Marshall in Marbury v. Madison
	- supports Holmes' version and places limits on the brief writer's version
	- people as the ultimate authority, all resides in the constitution
		- certain authority given to each branch via this document
	- but when one of the branches oversteps, the constitution and judgement of the court must win over 
- thus, a mere change in public opinion should not change the meaning:
	- "A merely temporary majoritarian groundswell should not abrogate some individual liberty truly protected by the Constitution"
- lots of room in const. = lots of room for debate and argument
- the debates before the ratification as the best version of public decision-making, when compared to congress, etc. 
	- ratification was still fresh in Marshall's mind
- brief writer's version seems to see that federal judges can have an independent will to solve problems
	- they are thus a small group of people who can just veto whatever, not voted, it's an issue
		- if there will be a revisional group, they should be elected, no? or at least have to be reappointed by the president and even confirmed by congress
- fun quote from Hughes: ==We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is.== — 6
- but three key flaws in the brief writer's version of the constitution: 
	- misconceives nature of constitution: designed to allow the popular branches to keep the country abreast of the times
		- constitution was designed to be indefinite! 
			- "Limitations were indeed placed upon both federal and state governments in the form of both a division of powers and express protection for individual rights. These limitations, however, were not themselves designed to solve the problems of the future, but were instead designed to make certain that the constituent branches, when they attempted to solve those problems, should not transgress these fundamental limitations." — 7
				- if the other branches didn't fix a problem, the federal court will! 
					- but surely the other branches aren't in a "quiz show," right? 
	- ignores the SC's past disasters with a living constitution
		- peak of this: Dred Scott v Sanford 
		- looks to the history before dred scott to see all of the chaos and argument about it
			- and the long-time damage that DS caused! 
		- second example: Lockner v New York
			- example of why a dissent is important! about labour hours in NY
			- quote from Holmes:
				- "A constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory, whether of paternalism and the organic relation of the citizen to the state or of laissez faire. It is made for people of fundamentally differing views, and the accident of our finding certain opinions natural and familiar or novel and even shocking ought not to conclude our judgment upon the question whether statutes embodying them conflict with the Constitution of the United States." — 11
		- all ended in failure b/c most scholars concluded they brought in the wrong principle
	- even if the social changes are correct, having them be dictated by an independent judiciary is bad
		- in our constitution, representatives in executive and legislature enact laws
		- beyond the const, no basis other than individual conscience for moral judgements
		- another great Holmes quote on natural law and human morality 
- shouldn't be easy for people to shove in their own opinions via law 
- final paragraph: 
	- "To the extent that it makes possible an individual's persuading one or more appointed federal judges to impose on other individuals a rule of conduct that the popularly elected branches of government would not have enacted and the voters have not and would not have embodied in the Constitution, the brief writer's version of the living Constitution is genuinely corrosive of the fundamental values of our democratic society." — 14
