- question of belief in a living constitution asked constantly at confirmation hearings
- no set meaning, two key meanings:
	- Holmes version, from 1920:
		- When we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters. It was enough for them to realize or to hope that they had created an organism; it has taken a century and has cost their successors much sweat and blood to prove that they created a nation. -- 2
			- general language as left by the founders to allow the constitution to be applied to new environments:
				- "Merely because a particular activity may not have existed when the Constitution was adopted, or because the framers could not have conceived of a particular method of transacting affairs, cannot mean that general language in the Constitution may not be applied to such a course of conduct." — 2
	- "brief-writer's version: 
		- "Under this brief writer's version of the living Constitution, nonelected members of the federal judiciary may address themselves to a social problem simply because other branches of government have failed or refused to do so." — 3
- all about the issues about the second version: brief-writer's! 
- a suggested philosophical approach of judicial review
	- generally accepted that the "ideal" judicial review is antidemocratic! 
- example of Marshall in Marbury v. Madison
	- supports Holmes' version and places limits on the brief writer's version
	- people as the ultimate authority, all resides in the constitution
		- certain authority given to each branch via this document
	- but when one of the branches oversteps, the constitution and judgement of the court must win over 
- thus, a mere change in public opinion should not change the meaning:
	- "A merely temporary majoritarian groundswell should not abrogate some individual liberty truly protected by the Constitution"
- lots of room in const. = lots of room for debate and argument
- the debates before the ratification as the best version of public decision-making, when compared to congress, etc. 
	- ratification was still fresh in Marshall's mind
- brief writer's version seems to see that federal judges can have an independent will to solve problems
	- they are thus a small group of people who can just veto whatever, not voted, it's an issue
		- if there will be a revisional group, they should be elected, no? or at least have to be reappointed by the president and even confirmed by congress
- fun quote from Hughes: ==We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is.== — 6
- but three key flaws in the brief writer's version of the constitution: 
	- misconceives nature of constitution: designed to allow the popular branches to keep the country abreast of the times
		- constitution was designed to be indefinite! 
			- "Limitations were indeed placed upon both federal and state governments in the form of both a division of powers and express protection for individual rights. These limitations, however, were not themselves designed to solve the problems of the future, but were instead designed to make certain that the constituent branches, when they attempted to solve those problems, should not transgress these fundamental limitations." — 7
				- if the other branches didn't fix a problem, the federal court will! 
					- but surely the other branches aren't in a "quiz show," right? 
	- ignores the SC's past disasters with a living constitution
		- peak of this: Dred Scott v Sanford 
		- looks to the history before dred scott to see all of the chaos and argument about it
			- and the long-time damage that DS caused! 
		- second example: Lockner v New York
			- example of why a dissent is important! about labour hours in NY
			- quote from Holmes:
				- "A constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory, whether of paternalism and the organic relation of the citizen to the state or of laissez faire. It is made for people of fundamentally differing views, and the accident of our finding certain opinions natural and familiar or novel and even shocking ought not to conclude our judgment upon the question whether statutes embodying them conflict with the Constitution of the United States." — 11
		- all ended in failure b/c most scholars concluded they brought in the wrong principle
	- even if the social changes are correct, having them be dictated by an independent judiciary is bad
		- in our constitution, representatives in executive and legislature enact laws
		- beyond the const, no basis other than individual conscience for moral judgements
		- another great Holmes quote on natural law and human morality 
- shouldn't be easy for people to shove in their own opinions via law 
- final paragraph: 
	- "To the extent that it makes possible an individual's persuading one or more appointed federal judges to impose on other individuals a rule of conduct that the popularly elected branches of government would not have enacted and the voters have not and would not have embodied in the Constitution, the brief writer's version of the living Constitution is genuinely corrosive of the fundamental values of our democratic society." — 14
