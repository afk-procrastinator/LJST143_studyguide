## [[Schauer; Precedent.pdf]]
^96b7d4
- basically, why do we follow precedent? what defines something as a precedent? 
- the treatment of event in X like Y in the past — only bc of that — means trading X with Y if X occurs again
	- not just a court thing — seen throughout law
- good quotes on the importance of precedence in life on pg 2? 
- must look at non-legal precedent to understand legal precedent 
### forward-looking aspect of precedent 
- actions today can be used as precedent in the future
- a balance of past and future 
- but must deal with past through decisionmaker's *words*
	- so need to disentangle effect of a past decision from the effect of words
		- what was *done* versus what was *said*
- example of the kid on p3
- the language as creating the rule! 
	- these future-focused arguments as very common! 
- but being constrained by precedent involves things outside of being constrained by specific normative language 
### isolating the argument from precedent 
- argument from precedent; argument from experience
	- i.e. a sentencing is an argument/experience, not a precedent 
- even if we think a past decision was wrong, the fact that it was decided before at all gives it value
- precedent as a *rule* of precedent — non-constraining
	- if seen as a rule, only think that matters is the result of the decisions, not on the validity 
- but the hierarchy of decisionmakers (aka courts) implicated "considerations different from those involved when a decisionmaker is constrained but its previous actions as opposed to the orders of its superiors in the hierarchy" — 6
	- so who wins? superior court of precedent
- but does precedent matter at all, and if so, how? 
### can precedent constrain?
- rules of relevance
	- looking back to see if a case is relevant — is X close enough to Y?
		- not all events are identical at all
	- an organization of *rules of relevance* can distinguish what is important 
		- existence of distinct principles show that things that once mattered don't anymore — i.e. race within a case
	- "Precedent depends on rules, and those rules themselves depend on context." — 8
	- assuming the case will be important in the future presupposes some kind of relevance
	- key issue is one of *assimilation* — how to group facts and events in the world
		- no matter how easy/hard, it is necessary for precedent at all
- categories of decision and categories of the world 
	- where do the rules allowing us to say X is close enough to Y come from? 
- **the articulated characterisation**
	- aka importance of language used 
	- distinctive characterisation can limit the use of future connections to a case
		- assumed to be "mere dicta," but doesn't want to turn to question of dicta and holdings 
	- thus, characterisation acts like a rule — rules can be broken, but justifying breaking it is much harder 
		- so, how much can this language constrain/limit? 
	- removing the characterisation makes precedent much clearer 
		- everything has characterisations in the world! 
			- when we worry about future applications of an event, usually due to a lack of authoritative characterisation separating things! 
	- so, if there is no characterisation, is precedent restraining at all? 
- **roots of characterisation**
	- for any decision, are there restraints on the categories of assimilation that let us link past to future? 
	- *naturalism:* language as only recognising existing categories
		- this is the more formalist category
			- formalist only asks if X and Y are similar, not how are why they are 
	- *nominalism:* subdivisions are artificial due to culture
		- more realist 
			- but this approach makes everything much weaker, easy to change 
			- so judges should make their cases for *today*
- these are caricatures, but useful 
	- formalism as better as describing immediate actions of individuals than nominalists! 
- again, categorisation is central to life! 
	- this isn't controversial, everyone does it! 
- if a category doesn't exist, much easier than when it does
- reliance on english categories, social and linguistic from the wider environment 
- everything about precedent just relies on categories! 
	- and constrains the context!

## [[Rehnquist; The Notion of Living Text.pdf]]

^406221

- question of belief in a living constitution asked constantly at confirmation hearings
- no set meaning, two key meanings:
	- Holmes version, from 1920:
		- When we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters. It was enough for them to realize or to hope that they had created an organism; it has taken a century and has cost their successors much sweat and blood to prove that they created a nation. -- 2
			- general language as left by the founders to allow the constitution to be applied to new environments:
				- "Merely because a particular activity may not have existed when the Constitution was adopted, or because the framers could not have conceived of a particular method of transacting affairs, cannot mean that general language in the Constitution may not be applied to such a course of conduct." — 2
	- "brief-writer's version: 
		- "Under this brief writer's version of the living Constitution, nonelected members of the federal judiciary may address themselves to a social problem simply because other branches of government have failed or refused to do so." — 3
- all about the issues about the second version: brief-writer's! 
- a suggested philosophical approach of judicial review
	- generally accepted that the "ideal" judicial review is antidemocratic! 
- example of Marshall in Marbury v. Madison
	- supports Holmes' version and places limits on the brief writer's version
	- people as the ultimate authority, all resides in the constitution
		- certain authority given to each branch via this document
	- but when one of the branches oversteps, the constitution and judgement of the court must win over 
- thus, a mere change in public opinion should not change the meaning:
	- "A merely temporary majoritarian groundswell should not abrogate some individual liberty truly protected by the Constitution"
- lots of room in const. = lots of room for debate and argument
- the debates before the ratification as the best version of public decision-making, when compared to congress, etc. 
	- ratification was still fresh in Marshall's mind
- brief writer's version seems to see that federal judges can have an independent will to solve problems
	- they are thus a small group of people who can just veto whatever, not voted, it's an issue
		- if there will be a revisional group, they should be elected, no? or at least have to be reappointed by the president and even confirmed by congress
- fun quote from Hughes: ==We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is.== — 6
- but three key flaws in the brief writer's version of the constitution: 
	- misconceives nature of constitution: designed to allow the popular branches to keep the country abreast of the times
		- constitution was designed to be indefinite! 
			- "Limitations were indeed placed upon both federal and state governments in the form of both a division of powers and express protection for individual rights. These limitations, however, were not themselves designed to solve the problems of the future, but were instead designed to make certain that the constituent branches, when they attempted to solve those problems, should not transgress these fundamental limitations." — 7
				- if the other branches didn't fix a problem, the federal court will! 
					- but surely the other branches aren't in a "quiz show," right? 
	- ignores the SC's past disasters with a living constitution
		- peak of this: Dred Scott v Sanford 
		- looks to the history before dred scott to see all of the chaos and argument about it
			- and the long-time damage that DS caused! 
		- second example: Lockner v New York
			- example of why a dissent is important! about labour hours in NY
			- quote from Holmes:
				- "A constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory, whether of paternalism and the organic relation of the citizen to the state or of laissez faire. It is made for people of fundamentally differing views, and the accident of our finding certain opinions natural and familiar or novel and even shocking ought not to conclude our judgment upon the question whether statutes embodying them conflict with the Constitution of the United States." — 11
		- all ended in failure b/c most scholars concluded they brought in the wrong principle
	- even if the social changes are correct, having them be dictated by an independent judiciary is bad
		- in our constitution, representatives in executive and legislature enact laws
		- beyond the const, no basis other than individual conscience for moral judgements
		- another great Holmes quote on natural law and human morality 
- shouldn't be easy for people to shove in their own opinions via law 
- final paragraph: 
	- "To the extent that it makes possible an individual's persuading one or more appointed federal judges to impose on other individuals a rule of conduct that the popularly elected branches of government would not have enacted and the voters have not and would not have embodied in the Constitution, the brief writer's version of the living Constitution is genuinely corrosive of the fundamental values of our democratic society." — 14
