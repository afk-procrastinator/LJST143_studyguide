# [[Caruth; Trauma.pdf]]
^f0d4f6
- discusses PTSD, changes in understanding the medical aspect of it 
- impossible to describe, a distortion of the events
	- the *structure of its experience* — not felt immediately, but in hindsight, in repeated possession 
- PTSD as a symptom of *history*
	- traumatised carry an "impossible" history 
		- uncertain of one's own history
- a crisis of *truth* — access to one's own history 
	- "bearing witness" to the event could not happen during it 
- a delayed return of the memory 
	- history of trauma is that is is perceived late; history of it can be grasped only by inaccessibility of the occurence 
- potentiality of psychoanalysis
- for the traumatised, it's not only the moment but the passing out of it that is traumatic — the survival itself as a crisis! 
- listening to the crisis of trauma is not only the event, but learning to listen to departure
