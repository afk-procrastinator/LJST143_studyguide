# [[Caruth; Trauma.pdf]]
^f0d4f6
- discusses PTSD, changes in understanding the medical aspect of it 
- impossible to describe, a distortion of the events
	- the *structure of its experience* — not felt immediately, but in hindsight, in repeated possession 
- PTSD as a symptom of *history*
	- traumatised carry an "impossible" history 
		- uncertain of one's own history
- a crisis of *truth* — access to one's own history 
	- "bearing witness" to the event could not happen during it 
- a delayed return of the memory 
	- history of trauma is that is is perceived late; history of it can be grasped only by inaccessibility of the occurence 
- potentiality of psychoanalysis
- for the traumatised, it's not only the moment but the passing out of it that is traumatic — the survival itself as a crisis! 
- listening to the crisis of trauma is not only the event, but learning to listen to departure 
## quotes: 
2: The phenomenon of trauma has seemed to become all-inclusive, but it has done so precisely because it brings us to the limits of our understanding: if psychoanalysis, psychiatry, sociology, and even literature are beginning to hear each other anew in the study of trauma, it is because they are listening through the radical disruption and gaps of traumatic experience.
2: While  the  precise  definition  o f  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  is  contested,  most descriptions generally agree  that  there  is  a response,  sometimes delayed,  to  an  overwhelming  event  or  events,  which  takes  the  form  o f  repeated,  intrusive  hallucinations,  dreams,  thoughts  or  behaviors  stemming from the event, along with numbing that m ay have begun during or after the experience,  and possibly also increased arousal to  (and avoidance of)  stimuli recalling  the event.
