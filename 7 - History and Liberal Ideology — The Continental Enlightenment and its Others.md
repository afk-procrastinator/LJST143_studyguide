# [[Mill; The Criterion of a Good Form of Government.pdf]]

^ce04e9
- government as managing the limits of good/bad for people to access
> But I apprehend that (however admissible for purposes of popular discourse) the distinction between Order, or Permanence, and Progress, employed to define the qualities necessary in a government, is unscientific and incorrect — 3
- order as obedience
	- obedience is necessary, but not key objective
	- plus, not everyone will obey — there are always shades/variations of obedience
- order = preservation of peace by stopping violence
	- order as a *condition*, not the goal of government 
	- order preserves existing good, and progress increases the good that exists
> If so, whatever qualities in the government are promotive of industry, integrity, justice, and prudence, conduce alike to permanence and to progression; only there is needed more of those qualities to make the society decidedly progressive than merely to keep it permanent.
- invention/originality as the best way to encourage progress
	- but new issues come up, so fighting just to maintain the current good that exists 
	- and can only invent when we are physically safe
- economic necessity for progress
>  It holds, in short, universally, that when Order and Permanence are taken in their widest sense, for the stability of existing advantages, the requisites of Progress are but the requisites of Order in a greater degree; those of Permanence merely those of Progress in a somewhat smaller measure.

> No more does Progress in one thing imply Progress in everything. Progress of any kind includes Permanence in that same kind; whenever Permanence is sacrificed to some particular kind of Progress, other Progress is still more sacrificed to it; and if it be not worth the sacrifice, not the interest of Permanence alone has been disregarded, but the general interest of Progress has been mistaken.
- best gov is not one that encourages order, but *progress*
	- progress contains order, but not vice versa
> The natural tendency of men and their works was to degenerate, which tendency, however, by good institutions virtuously administered, it might be possible for an indefinite length of time to counteract
- we move back if we aren't moving forward
> The fundamental antithesis which these words express does not lie in the things themselves, so much as in the types of human character which answer to them.
- a balance will arise normally between "progress" and "order" — present vs future oriented
> If we ask ourselves on what causes and conditions good government in all its senses, from the humblest to the most exalted, depends, we find that the principal of them, the one which transcends all others, is the qualities of the human beings composing the society over which the government is exercised.
- the individuals within society as central to everything
	- obedience, morality, etc. — bribery, etc. 
	- and some intelligence too: 
> 		The influence of defects of intelligence in obstructing all the elements of good government requires no illustration. Government consists of acts done by human beings; and if the agents, or those who choose the agents, or those to whom the agents are responsible, or the lookers-on whose opinion ought to influence and check all these, are mere masses of ignorance, stupidity, and baleful prejudice, every operation of government will go wrong; while, in proportion as the men rise above this standard, so will the government improve in quality; up to the point of excellence, attainable but nowhere attained, where the officers of government, themselves persons of superior virtue and intellect, are surrounded by the atmosphere of a virtuous and enlightened public opinion.
- but at the end of the day the *people* are most important 
	- also: how the government makes *use* of what they have
		- system needs to bring the society's morality and intellectuality into justice, make it operate on the result
> What we have said of the arrangements for the detailed administration of the government is still more evidently true of its general constitution. All government which aims at being good is an organisation of some part of the good qualities existing in the individual members of the community for the conduct of its collective affairs. A representative constitution is a means of bringing the general standard of intelligence and honesty existing in the community, and the individual intellect and virtue of its wisest members, more directly to bear upon the government, and investing them with greater influence in it, than they would in general have under any other mode of organisation; though, under any, such influence as they do have is the source of all good that there is in the government, and the hindrance of every evil that there is not. The greater the amount of these good qualities which the institutions of a country succeed in organising, and the better the mode of organisation, the better will be the government.
- government as being judged by *actions*, not words
- the actual structure of the government doesn't matter, it varies with current stages of advancement
	- as long as its good! 
- sees slavery as "accelerating" transition to more freedoms??!
- 21 -> discussion of slavery
	- slaves couldn't make their own government, they would have to be shown and guided by others
>  A people of savages should be taught obedience but not in such a manner as to convert them into a people of slaves. 
- somewhat excuses(?) colonialism — example of the jewish, limited by religion?
>  It follows, that to judge of the merits of forms of government, an ideal must be constructed of the form of government most eligible in itself, that is, which, if the necessary conditions existed for giving effect to its beneficial tendencies, would, more than all others, favour and promote not some one improvement, but all forms and degrees of it
- comes to a final conclusion:
> Of these inquiries, the last does not concern us here; but the first is an essential part of our subject: for we may, without rashness, at once enunciate a proposition, the proofs and illustrations of which will present themselves in the ensuing pages; that this ideally best form of government will be found in some one or other variety of the Representative System.
