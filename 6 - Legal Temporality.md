# [[Hart; Sovereign and Subject.pdf]]

- question of sovereign power
	- in all forms of law, there is a subject who is obedient to some kind of sovereign
	- can speak of sovereign and state's laws as the same
- to make a habit:
	- continuity
	- persistence
- also, is sov still subject to the law? 
## the habit of obedience and the continuity of law
- law: general orders backed by threats
	- we can get habit from law - i.e. driving 
- habits are unreflective, effortless — law can't automatically be a habit when it's against our inclinations 
- "population" having a habit only means *most*, not all of them
	- each individual only needs to obey
- societal unity through a shared single leader
- habit for one ruler doesn't necessarily mean habit for the next 
	- only after they have been obeyed for some time can we see if they're habit or not — 4
- so sov makes the right for the sucessor to rule 
	- law might not be fully obedient yet, but he still has the *right* to make it 
	- just saying he has the right isn't enough 
- habitual obedience falls to continuity: 
	- habits to old legislator can't give new legislator rights automatically
	- habitual obedience in the past doesn't mean it will be in the present 
- closeness of a habit and a rule
	- behavior is general, but not invariable 
	- repeated by most 
- but differences:
	- behaviour for several converges 
	- derivation from the standard must have good reason 
		- if people who follow a rule exist, those who don't will as well
	- internal aspect of rules 
		- social rules has internal — as well as external, similar to regular behaviour from outside
- feeling "bound" to something does not mean actual "binding"
- sov's own *words* as a standard of behavior 
- rule of conferring future right (to make rules) *as* a future rule itself — refers to lawgivers in the future as well as now 
	- allows both the right to make law; as well as likelihood for continued obedience 
- link between succession and rule-following, but one doesn't necessarily include the other! 
- habits are not normative
- habits of one cannot be the habits of all

- how would we put a king on trial? 
	- if they are truly sovereign, they don't listen to law, but law
- charging with law as a greater wrong than assassination
	- example of france
- assassination vs execution 
	- execution as political — there has a legal basis, a legal wrong 
	- revolution is justifiable when it's for just ends
