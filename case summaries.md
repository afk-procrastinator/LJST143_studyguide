# [[1 - The Meaning and Rhetoric of History#^1c39de|Palsgraf v Long Island Railroad Co]]
## Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co. - 248 N.Y. 339
### RULE:
If no hazard is apparent to the eye of ordinary vigilance, an act innocent and harmless, at least to outward seeming, with reference to a plaintiff, does not take to itself the quality of a tort because it happened to be a wrong, though apparently not one involving the risk of bodily insecurity, with reference to someone else. In every instance, before negligence can be predicated of a given act, back of the act must be sought and found a duty to the individual complaining, the observance of which would have averted or avoided the injury. The ideas of negligence and duty are strictly correlative.

### FACTS:
Plaintiff ticket-holding passenger Helen Palsgraf was standing on a platform of defendant Long Island Railroad Company. A man carrying a package jumped aboard the car of a moving train at a nearby platform. A guard in the car reached to help him in, and a guard on the platform pushed the man from behind. The package was dislodged, fell onto the rails, and exploded. The shock of the explosion caused a scales to fall onto plaintiff passenger, who filed this lawsuit for injuries due to defendant's alleged negligence. The trial term court (the Supreme Court) entered a verdict for plaintiff. In 1927, the Supreme Court, Appellate Division affirmed the judgment in favor of plaintiff. These two lower courts held that the negligent acts of the railroad's employees caused the package that contained explosives to be thrown under the train where they exploded. Defendant railroad sought appeal to the Court of Appeals of New York.
(Procedural note: In the New York state court system, the Supreme Court is the trial level. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division hears cases on first appeal. The highest court is the Court of Appeals of New York -- this is the court for the instant decision.)

### ISSUE:
In an action for injuries sustained during an explosion when a package was dropped on a nearby rail, was defendant railroad liable for negligence due to its guards' conduct in pushing the man carrying the package?

### ANSWER:
No

### CONCLUSION:
In 1928, the Court of Appeals of New York reversed the judgments of the appellate division and the trial term of the Supreme Court. Ruling in favor of defendant railroad, the Court dismissed plaintiff passenger's complaint. The Court found that the conduct of the railroad's guards was not a wrong or negligence in relation to plaintiff, standing far away. There was nothing in the situation to suggest to the most cautious mind that the parcel wrapped in newspaper would spread wreckage through the station. The Court explained that negligence is not actionable unless it involves the invasion of a legally protected interest--the violation of a right, which in this case was claimed to be the right to be protected against interference with one's bodily security. Bodily security is not protected against all forms of interference or aggression, but only against some. Negligence is the absence of care, according to the circumstances. The Court concluded that there was no negligence because defendant railroad could not have reasonably foreseen that its employees' conduct would have resulted in injury to plaintiff Palsgraff. The Court noted that the plaintiff had sued in her own right for a wrong personal to her, and not as the vicarious beneficiary of a breach of duty to another.

# [[2 - Evidence and Knowledge — History, Proof, and the Demand for Judgment#^bd5b1a|Commonwealth v Webster]]
## Commonwealth v. Webster - 59 Mass. 295 (1850)
### RULE:
Homicide, of which murder is the highest and most criminal species, is of various degrees, according to circumstances. The term, in its largest sense, is generic, embracing every mode by which the life of one man is taken by the act of another. Homicide may be lawful or unlawful; it is lawful when done in lawful war upon an enemy in battle; it is lawful when done by an officer in the execution of justice upon a criminal, pursuant to a proper warrant. It may also be justifiable, and of course lawful, in necessary self-defense.

### FACTS:
Defendant was indicted for the murder of Dr. George Parkman. The indictment contained four counts, the first of which alleged the crime to have been committed by stabbing with a knife, the second by a blow on the head with a hammer; and the third by striking, kicking, beating, and throwing on the ground. The fourth count stated that defendant feloniously, willfully, and of malice aforethought killed and murder Dr. Parkman. The trial court instructed the jury on the applicable law in the case. Because of the lack of direct evidence of defendant's guilt, the trial court then advised the jury on the differences between direct and circumstantial evidence.

### ISSUE:
Can the grand jury decide based on available evidence that the defendant killed and murder the victim?

### ANSWER:
Yes.

### CONCLUSION:
The court instructed the jury on the applicable law in defendant's murder trial. The rules of law require the grand jury to state their charge with as much certainty as the circumstances of the case will permit; and, if the circumstances will not permit a fuller and more precise statement of the mode in which the death is occasioned, in this count conforms to the rules of law.

# [[2 - Evidence and Knowledge — History, Proof, and the Demand for Judgment#^7e0637|Herrera v Texas]]
## Herrera v. Collins - 506 U.S. 390, 113 S. Ct. 853 (1993)
### RULE:
A petitioner otherwise subject to defenses of abusive or successive use of the writ may have his federal constitutional claim considered on the merits if he makes a proper showing of actual innocence. This rule, or fundamental miscarriage of justice exception, is grounded in the "equitable discretion" of habeas courts to see that federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarceration of innocent persons. But this body of habeas jurisprudence makes clear that a claim of "actual innocence" is not itself a constitutional claim, but instead a gateway through which a habeas petitioner must pass to have his otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on the merits.

### FACTS:
Herrera was convicted of the capital murder of Police Officer Carrisalez and sentenced to death in January 1982. The conviction was based on two eyewitness identifications, numerous pieces of circumstantial evidence and petitioner Herrera's handwritten letter impliedly admitting his guilt. In July 1982, Herrera pleaded guilty to the related capital murder of Officer Rucker. Herrera unsuccessfully challenged the Carrisalez conviction on direct appeal and in two collateral proceedings in the Texas state courts, and in a federal habeas petition. Ten years after his conviction, he urged in a second federal habeas proceeding that newly discovered evidence demonstrated that he was "actually innocent" of the murders of Carrisalez and Rucker and that his execution was prohibited by the [Eighth](https://advance.lexis.com/search/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=3d88bec5-8e25-4d95-b039-6a173432e0ac&pdsearchterms=Herrera+v.+Collins%2C+506+U.S.+390+(1993)&pdstartin=hlct%3A1%3A1&pdtypeofsearch=searchboxclick&pdsearchtype=SearchBox&pdqttype=and&pdquerytemplateid=&ecomp=v5q1k&prid=f02666ac-3f3b-4834-a47a-90e8d0d8aa4e) Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and that the [Fourteenth Amendment's](https://advance.lexis.com/search/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=3d88bec5-8e25-4d95-b039-6a173432e0ac&pdsearchterms=Herrera+v.+Collins%2C+506+U.S.+390+(1993)&pdstartin=hlct%3A1%3A1&pdtypeofsearch=searchboxclick&pdsearchtype=SearchBox&pdqttype=and&pdquerytemplateid=&ecomp=v5q1k&prid=f02666ac-3f3b-4834-a47a-90e8d0d8aa4e) due process guarantee. Herrera presented affidavits tending to show that his now-dead brother had committed the murders. The district court granted his request for a stay of execution so that he could present his actual innocence claim and the supporting affidavits in state court. In vacating the stay, the court of appeals held that the claim was not cognizable on federal habeas absent an accompanying federal constitutional violation.

### ISSUE:
Was Herrera entitled to federal habeas corpus relief?

### ANSWER:
No.

### CONCLUSION:
The Court held that Herrera's claim of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence was not a ground for federal habeas corpus relief absent an independent constitutional violation. According to the Court, the State met its burden of proving that the inmate was guilty of the capital murder beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. Thus, the inmate did not come before the courts as one who was "innocent," but as one who had been convicted by due process of law. The Court posited that Texas' refusal to entertain Herrera's newly discovered evidence eight years after his conviction did not transgress any principle of fundamental fairness.

# [[4 - The Making of Constitutional History — Precedent#^bc689b|Casey v Planned Parenthood]]

^9c55f5

## Planned Parenthood v. Casey - 505 U.S. 833, 112 S. Ct. 2791 (1992)

^5c46e0

### RULE:
The Court reaffirms Roe v. Wade's essential holding, which has three parts. First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State. Before viability, the State's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure. Second is a confirmation of the State's power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life or health. And third is the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child. These principles do not contradict one another.

### FACTS:
A Pennsylvania abortion statute was amended to provide that (1) a woman seeking an abortion is required to give her informed consent prior to the abortion procedure and to be provided, at least 24 hours before the abortion is performed, with certain information concerning her decision whether to undergo an abortion, (2) a minor seeking an abortion is required to obtain the informed consent of one of her parents or guardians, but has available a judicial bypass option if the minor does not wish to or cannot obtain such consent, (3) unless certain exceptions apply, a married woman seeking an abortion is required to sign a statement indicating that she has notified her husband of her intended abortion, (4) compliance with the foregoing requirements is exempted in the event of a "medical emergency," which term is defined in another statutory provision as a pregnant woman's medical condition that on the basis of a physician's good-faith clinical judgment, necessitates an immediate abortion to avert the woman's death or to avert a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function, and (5) facilities providing abortion services are subject to certain reporting and record-keeping requirements, which do not include the disclosure of the identities of women who have undergone abortions, but which include a requirement of reporting of a married woman's failure to provide notice to her husband of her intended abortion. Before any of these provisions took effect, five abortion clinics and one physician representing himself as well as a class of physicians who provided abortion services brought suit seeking declaratory and  relief on the allegation that each provision was unconstitutional on its face. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, after entering a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the provisions, held that all the provisions were unconstitutional and entered a permanent injunction against the state's enforcement of the provisions. The court of appeals reversed in part, holding that only the husband notification provision, was unconstitutional.

### ISSUE:
Was the requirement on married women to notify their husbands before undergoing an abortion presents a substantial obstacle on their choice, and therefore invalid?

### ANSWER:
Yes.

### CONCLUSION:
The Court applied the doctrine of stare decisis and reaffirmed the essential holdings in Roe v. Wade because that decision was still workable and its factual underpinnings had not changed. In a joint opinion, three Justices rejected Roe's trimester framework and adopted an undue burden test for determining whether State regulations had the purpose or effect of placing substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before viability. The Court agreed that the statute imposed a substantial obstacle in a large fraction of cases and was invalid. The Court also affirmed the holding the court of appeals that the medical emergency provision did not impose an undue burden on a woman's abortion right. A plurality of the Court determined that the statute was also invalid because it required a married woman to provide a reason for her failure to provide notice to her husband.

# [[4 - The Making of Constitutional History — Precedent#^fe0bd3|Ramos v Louisiana]]
## Ramos v. Louisiana - 206 L.Ed.2d 583 (U.S. 2020)
### RULE:
The [Sixth Amendment](https://advance.lexis.com/search/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=69ed0c34-252a-41ea-a8d0-5bc72439bd65&pdsearchterms=Ramos+v.+Louisiana%2C+206+L.+Ed.+2d+583&pdstartin=hlct%3A1%3A1&pdtypeofsearch=searchboxclick&pdsearchtype=SearchBox&pdqttype=and&pdquerytemplateid=&ecomp=2gp3k&prid=7ecf6774-ce72-429e-bc25-cd2d8aad209c) requires unanimity. A defendant enjoys a constitutional right to demand that his liberty should not be taken from him except by the joint action of the court and the unanimous verdict of a jury of 12 persons. The [Sixth Amendment](https://advance.lexis.com/search/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=69ed0c34-252a-41ea-a8d0-5bc72439bd65&pdsearchterms=Ramos+v.+Louisiana%2C+206+L.+Ed.+2d+583&pdstartin=hlct%3A1%3A1&pdtypeofsearch=searchboxclick&pdsearchtype=SearchBox&pdqttype=and&pdquerytemplateid=&ecomp=2gp3k&prid=7ecf6774-ce72-429e-bc25-cd2d8aad209c) affords a right to a trial by jury as understood and applied at common law, including all the essential elements as they were recognized in this country and England when the Constitution was adopted. This includes a requirement that the verdict should be unanimous. 

### FACTS:
In 48 States and federal court, a single juror’s vote to acquit is enough to prevent a conviction. But two States, Louisiana and Oregon, have long punished people based on 10-to-2 verdicts. In this case, petitioner Evangelisto Ramos was convicted of a serious crime in a Louisiana court by a 10-to-2 jury verdict. Instead of the mistrial he would have received almost anywhere else, Ramos was sentenced to life without parole. He contests his conviction by a non-unanimous jury as an unconstitutional denial of the [Sixth Amendment](https://advance.lexis.com/search/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=69ed0c34-252a-41ea-a8d0-5bc72439bd65&pdsearchterms=Ramos+v.+Louisiana%2C+206+L.+Ed.+2d+583&pdstartin=hlct%3A1%3A1&pdtypeofsearch=searchboxclick&pdsearchtype=SearchBox&pdqttype=and&pdquerytemplateid=&ecomp=2gp3k&prid=7ecf6774-ce72-429e-bc25-cd2d8aad209c) right to a jury trial. The United States Supreme Court granted Ramos' petition for certiorari review.

### ISSUE:
Was Ramos’ conviction by a non-unanimous jury a denial of the [Sixth Amendment](https://advance.lexis.com/search/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=69ed0c34-252a-41ea-a8d0-5bc72439bd65&pdsearchterms=Ramos+v.+Louisiana%2C+206+L.+Ed.+2d+583&pdstartin=hlct%3A1%3A1&pdtypeofsearch=searchboxclick&pdsearchtype=SearchBox&pdqttype=and&pdquerytemplateid=&ecomp=2gp3k&prid=7ecf6774-ce72-429e-bc25-cd2d8aad209c) right to a jury trial?

### ANSWER:
Yes

### CONCLUSION:
The United States Supreme Court reversed the judgment of conviction, holding that the [Sixth Amendment](https://advance.lexis.com/search/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=69ed0c34-252a-41ea-a8d0-5bc72439bd65&pdsearchterms=Ramos+v.+Louisiana%2C+206+L.+Ed.+2d+583&pdstartin=hlct%3A1%3A1&pdtypeofsearch=searchboxclick&pdsearchtype=SearchBox&pdqttype=and&pdquerytemplateid=&ecomp=2gp3k&prid=7ecf6774-ce72-429e-bc25-cd2d8aad209c) right to a jury trial, as incorporated against the States by way of the [Fourteenth Amendment](https://advance.lexis.com/search/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=69ed0c34-252a-41ea-a8d0-5bc72439bd65&pdsearchterms=Ramos+v.+Louisiana%2C+206+L.+Ed.+2d+583&pdstartin=hlct%3A1%3A1&pdtypeofsearch=searchboxclick&pdsearchtype=SearchBox&pdqttype=and&pdquerytemplateid=&ecomp=2gp3k&prid=7ecf6774-ce72-429e-bc25-cd2d8aad209c), required a unanimous verdict to convict a defendant of a serious offense. At the time of the [Sixth Amendment](https://advance.lexis.com/search/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=69ed0c34-252a-41ea-a8d0-5bc72439bd65&pdsearchterms=Ramos+v.+Louisiana%2C+206+L.+Ed.+2d+583&pdstartin=hlct%3A1%3A1&pdtypeofsearch=searchboxclick&pdsearchtype=SearchBox&pdqttype=and&pdquerytemplateid=&ecomp=2gp3k&prid=7ecf6774-ce72-429e-bc25-cd2d8aad209c)’s adoption, the right to trial by jury included a right to a unanimous verdict, and it was not the court's role to reassess whether the right to a unanimous jury was important enough to retain.

# [[5 - The Logic of History — Originalism#^cacccf|Heller v DC]]
## District of Columbia v. Heller - 554 U.S. 570, 128 S. Ct. 2783 (2008)
### RULE:
Like most rights, the right secured by the [Second Amendment](https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=36100308-6e30-40dc-833a-8f6fdb5c1c60&pddocfullpath=/shared/document/cases/urn:contentItem:4SVD-G000-TXFX-11T0-00000-00&pddocid=urn:contentItem:4SVD-G000-TXF) is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. Nothing in the Supreme Court's Heller opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms. The Supreme Court identifies presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples; the list does not purport to be exhaustive.

### FACTS:
District of Columbia law bans handgun possession by making it a crime to carry an unregistered firearm and prohibiting the registration of handguns; provides separately that no person may carry an unlicensed handgun, but authorizes the police chief to issue 1-year licenses; and requires residents to keep lawfully owned firearms unloaded and dissembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device. Respondent Heller, a D. C. special policeman, applied to register a handgun he wished to keep at home, but the District refused. He filed this suit seeking, on [Second Amendment](https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=36100308-6e30-40dc-833a-8f6fdb5c1c60&pddocfullpath=/) grounds, to enjoin the city from enforcing the bar on handgun registration, the licensing requirement insofar as it prohibits carrying an unlicensed firearm in the home, and the trigger-lock requirement insofar as it prohibits the use of functional firearms in the home. The District Court dismissed the suit, but the D. C. Circuit reversed, holding that the [Second Amendment](https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=36100308) protects an individual's right to possess firearms and that the city's total ban on handguns, as well as its requirement that firearms in the home be kept nonfunctional even when necessary for self-defense, violated that right.

### ISSUE:
Does the D.C. law prohibiting the possession of usable handguns within the home violate the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution?

### ANSWER:
Yes.

### CONCLUSION:
The Court held that the [Second Amendment](https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=36100308-6e30-40dc-833a-8f6fdb5c1c60&pddocfullpath=/shared/document/cases/urn:contentItem:4SVD-G000-TXFX-11T0-00000-00&pddocid=urn:) protected an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that firearm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. The Court determined that the [Second Amendment's](https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid) prefatory clause announced a purpose but did not limit or expand the scope of the operative clause. The operative clause's text and history demonstrated that it connoted an individual right to keep and bear arms, and the Court's reading of the operative clause was consistent with the announced purpose of the prefatory clause. None of the Court's precedents foreclosed its conclusions. The Court held that the [Second Amendment](https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=36100308-6e30-40dc-833a-8f6fdb5c1c60&pddocfullpath=/shared/document/cases/urn:contentItem:4SVD-G000-TXFX-11T0-00000-00&pddocid=urn) right was not unlimited, and it noted that its opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on certain long-standing prohibitions related to firearms.

# [[8 - Narrating the History of the Other#^3c062e|Montoya v US]]
## United States v. Montoya De Hernandez - 473 U.S. 531, 105 S. Ct. 3304 (1985)
### RULE:
The Fourth Amendment commands that searches and seizures be reasonable. What is reasonable depends upon all of the circumstances surrounding the search or seizure and the nature of the search or seizure itself.

### FACTS:
Upon her arrival at Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from Bogota, Colombia, respondent Rosa Elvira Montoya de Hernandez was detained by customs officials when, after examination of her passport and the contents of her valise and questioning by the officials, she was suspected of being a "balloon swallower," i. e., one who attempts to smuggle narcotics into the country hidden in her alimentary canal. She was detained incommunicado for almost 16 hours before the officials sought a court order authorizing a pregnancy test (she having claimed to be pregnant), an x-ray, and a rectal examination. During those 16 hours, she was given the option of returning to Colombia on the next available flight, agreeing to an x-ray, or remaining in detention until she produced a monitored bowel movement. She chose the first option, but the officials were unable to place her on the next flight, and she refused to use the toilet facilities. Pursuant to the court order, a pregnancy test was conducted at a hospital and proved negative, and a rectal examination resulted in the obtaining of 88 cocaine-filled balloons that had been smuggled in her alimentary canal. Subsequently, at trial in federal district and after a suppression hearing, the district court admitted the cocaine into evidence against respondent, and she was convicted of various federal narcotics offenses. The acourt of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's detention violated the Fourth Amendment because the customs officials did not have a "clear indication" of alimentary canal smuggling at the time respondent was detained.

### ISSUE:
Taking into consideration the circumstances of the case at hand, was respondent's detention violative of the Fourth Amendment?

### ANSWER:
No.

### CONCLUSION:
The Supreme Court of the United States held that the detention of a traveler at the border, beyond the scope of a routine customs search and inspection, was justified at its inception if customs agents, considering all the facts surrounding the traveler and her trip, reasonably suspect that the traveler was smuggling contraband in her alimentary canal. In respondent's case, the facts, and their rational inferences, known to the customs officials clearly supported a reasonable suspicion that respondent was an alimentary canal smuggler. Under the circumstances, respondent's detention, while long, uncomfortable, and humiliating, was not unreasonably long. When respondent refused an x-ray as an alternative to simply awaiting her bowel movement, the customs inspectors were left with only two practical alternatives: detain her for such time as necessary to confirm their suspicions or turn her loose into the interior of the country carrying the reasonably suspected contraband drugs. Moreover, both the length of respondent's detention and its discomfort resulted solely from the method that she chose to smuggle illicit drugs into this country. The Court held that in the presence of an articulable suspicion of alimentary canal smuggling, the customs officials were not required by the Fourth Amendment to pass respondent and her cocaine-filled balloons into the interior.

# [[9 - Law and Historical Trauma#^6ed954|Dred Scott v Sandford]]
## Scott v. Sandford - 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857)
### RULE:
The rights of property are united with the rights of person, and placed on the same ground by the [Fifth Amendment](https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=d94816ae-c115-45ab-82ab-9e09d7c5dd5b&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A3S4X-K2Y0-003B-H3CD-00000-00&pddocid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A3S4X-K2Y0-003B-H3CD-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=6443&pdshepid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A7XW4-F581-2NSF-C1XS-00000-00&pdteaserkey=sr0&pditab=allpods&ecomp=5pkLk&earg=sr0&prid=2ebd9f33-d71c-4c1e-921a-7fdde59edc73), which provides that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, and property, without due process of law. An act of Congress that deprives a citizen of the United States of his liberty or property, merely because he came himself or brought his property into a particular territory of the United States, and who has committed no offense against the laws, can hardly be dignified with the name of due process of law. 

### FACTS:
Petitioner-plaintiff in error Dred Scott was an enslaved person of African descent. He brought suit in the federal court against respondent "owner" Sandford for assault. Certiorari was granted from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Missouri finding that respondent was not liable to petitioner for assault. Prior to the institution of the present suit, an action was brought by Scott for his freedom in the Circuit Court of St. Louis county, (State court,) where there was a verdict and judgment in his favor. On a writ of error, the judgment below was reversed, and the case remanded to the Circuit Court, where it was continued to await the decision of the case now in question.

### ISSUE:
Did the Circuit Court of the United States have jurisdiction to hear and determine the 1856 case between these parties, one of who was held as a slave by defendant?

### ANSWER:
No.

### CONCLUSION:
In this 1856 landmark case, the Supreme Court of the United States posed the issue as "simply this: Can a negro, whose ancestors were imported into this country, and sold as slaves, become a member of the political community formed and brought into existence by the Constitution of the United States, and as such become entitled to all the rights, and privileges, and immunities, guarantied by that instrument to the citizen?" The Court found it necessary to determine who were citizens of the several States when the Constitution was adopted. In the Court's opinion, the legislation and histories of the times, and the language used in the Declaration of Independence, show, that neither the class of persons who had been imported as slaves, nor their descendants, whether they had become free or not, were then acknowledged as a part of the people, nor intended to be included in the general words used in that memorable instrument. The Court stated that there are two clauses in the Constitution which point directly and specifically to the "negro race as a separate class of persons, and show clearly that they were not regarded as a portion of the people or citizens of the Government then formed." The Court concluded that petitioner Scott did not gain his freedom by being transferred into a territory of the United States declared free by Congress because Congress's power to make rules and regulations for territories only applied to those territories belonging to the United States when the constitution was drafted. Therefore, the law making the territory free was unconstitutional. Finally, the Court held that petitioner did not gain his freedom by being taken into the free state of Illinois because the property laws of one state could not grant petitioner's freedom. The Court reversed the finding that respondent was not liable to petitioner for assault and remanded with an order to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction over petitioner's complaint.

# [[9 - Law and Historical Trauma#^7a24da|Plessy v Ferguson]]
## Plessy v. Ferguson - 163 U.S. 537, 16 S. Ct. 1138 (1896)
### RULE:
The object of the Fourteenth Amendment was undoubtedly to enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the law, but in the nature of things it could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political equality, or a commingling of the two races upon terms unsatisfactory to either. Laws permitting, and even requiring, their separation in places where they are liable to be brought into contact do not necessarily imply the inferiority of either race to the other, and have been generally, if not universally, recognized as within the competency of the state legislatures in the exercise of their police power.

### FACTS:
An American of 7/8 Caucasian and 1/8 African decent bought a first class train ticket from New Orleans to Covington. On the train, the passenger sat in a vacant seat where passengers of the white race were accommodated. The conductor required the passenger to vacate the coach and occupy another seat in a coach assigned for persons not of the white race, under penalty of ejection from said train and imprisonment. Upon his refusal to comply with the order, he was, with the aid of a police officer, forcibly ejected from said coach and imprisoned. He was also made to answer to a charge violating 1890 La. Acts No. 111. The constitutionality of the law was questioned. The Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana disagreed and denied petitioner's request for a writ of prohibition. The case was elevated on petition for writs of prohibition and certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.

### ISSUE:
Is a statute distinguishing between races unconstitutional and in violation of the Fourth Amendment?

### ANSWER:
No

### CONCLUSION:
The Court held that a statute that implied merely a legal distinction between differing races did not tend to destroy the legal equality of the two races or to reestablish a state of involuntary servitude. It held that when the government has secured to each of its citizens equal rights before the law and equal opportunities for improvement and progress, it has accomplished the end for which it was organized and performed all of the functions respecting social advantages with which it is endowed. Legislation is powerless to eradicate racial instincts or to abolish distinctions based upon physical differences, and the attempt to do so can only result in accentuating the difficulties of the present situation. If the civil and political rights of both races be equal one cannot be inferior to the other civilly or politically. If one race was inferior to another socially, the Federal Constitution could not put the two races upon the same plane.

# [[10 - The Limits of Repair#^877464|Brown v Board of Education]]
## Brown v. Bd. of Educ. - 808 F.2d 1445 (11th Cir. 1987)
### RULE:
The doctrine of "separate but equal" educational facilities is constitutionally unacceptable. School officials are obligated to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch. When school officials do not act according to that obligation, federal courts have the equitable power to fashion remedies for constitutional violations. A prerequisite to the exercise of that equitable power is a finding of a constitutional violation. When a school system has in the past operated a segregated system, a district court's remedy need not be founded on an independent constitutional violation. Each action of the school system, though not unconstitutional in itself or prompted by discriminatory motives, may be examined by a district court and set aside if it interferes with efforts to desegregate the system. 

### FACTS:
Appellee Board of Education of the City of Bessemer ("Bessemer") and appellant Board of Education of Jefferson County ("Jefferson") operated under a continuing court order ("Order") to desegregate and to provide a unitary system of education. The Order resulted from the Supreme Court of United States' decision in Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483 (1954). As a result of an unrelated lawsuit, Bessemer held annexation elections and 900 children who were attending Jefferson's schools became eligible to attend Bessemer's schools. Concerned that the influx of 900 students into the Bessemer school system would affect the court-approved unitary plan, Bessemer filed: (1) a motion to add Jefferson and its individual members as defendants in the 1954 Brown decision, and; (2) a motion for extraordinary relief ordering Jefferson to continue to educate the students in Parcel B. The motions were referred to a federal magistrate for an evidentiary hearing and recommendation. Bessemer presented evidence at the hearing that it could accommodate the influx of the students from Parcel A, but that the influx of students from Parcel B would prevent it from operating a unitary system under the Order. Accepting some of the magistrate's recommendations and rejecting others, the district court directed Bessemer to accept the responsibility for educating the students in Parcel A but required Jefferson to retain all responsibility for those students residing in Parcel B. Jefferson appealed that order.

### ISSUE:
Should Jefferson retain all responsibility for educating those students who resided in Parcel B?

### ANSWER:
Yes.

### CONCLUSION:
The court pf appeals affirmed the district court's order requiring Jefferson to retain responsibility for those students because the relief ordered was within the district court's equitable power. It held that where a school system had in the past operated a segregated system, the remedy did not have to be founded on an independent constitutional violation; the district court was preventing a change in school district boundaries that would have had a substantially segregative impact on Bessemer's school system. This was not an interdistrict remedy because no new or additional burden was being placed on Jefferson's school system.
