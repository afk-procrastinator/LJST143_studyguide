### section the first: on the study of law
- about... the study of law! wow! 
- sees law as a "science"
- looks down on EU unis lol
- civil law as a "collection of written reason" (2)
	- but an awareness of our past failures is also necessary
- young people should be educated early about their laws and constitutions 
- law as useful everywhere in life
	- speaks through an example — obliquely about England? 
	- private property
		- importance of knowing law in order to protect oneself and one's property 
	- also: wills and testaments
		- importance for future events as well, aka death
	- also also: serving on juries 
- need to know law for day-to-day behaviour and interactions with others
> 	"Else,  when  he  has  mistaken  his  authority,  through  passion, through  ignorance,  or  absurdity,  he  will  be  the  object  of  contempt  from  his inferiors,  and  of  censure  from  those  to  whom  he  is  accountable  for  his conduct." -6
- even more so in political representation
	- they are the "guardians" of the constitution
	- and duh, they need an understanding and knowledge of the land! 
- people don't see law as needing "apprenticeships"
	- assumed as some kind of natural right or ability 
- highly pro-common law 
	- places any blame of it's misuse on statute law! 
		- best to learn via experience — more and more knowledge is necessary
- higher the judge, the higher the stakes 
- references roman history a bit - 9
- knowledge of laww still highly useful for "learned" professions, now just judges and lawyers
	- applicability to the entirety of law and life - 10
	- same with those in religious and maritime — even if there's a small chance it's applicable, it needs to be understood!
> 		 In which  we  are  not  singular  in  our  notions;  for  even  in  Holland, where  the  imperial  law  is  much  cultivated  and  it's  decisions  pretty  generally followed, we are informed by Van Leeuwen[i],  that, "it receives  it's force from custom  and  the  consent  of  the  people,  either  tacitly  or  expressly  given:  for otherwise, he adds, we should no more be bound by this law, than by that of the Almains, the Franks, the Saxons, the Goths, the Vandals, and other of the antient  nations." - 11
- but this whole study hasn't been appreciated in universities! 
	- looks back in time — relates to the use of multiple languages in universities 
	- historicity of it: p14
- CL's value as coming from it **not being written at all**:
> 	BUt the  common  law  of  England,  being  not  committed  to  writing,  but only  handed  down  by  tradition,  use,  and  experience,  was  not  so  heartily relished by the foreign clergy; who came over hither in shoals during the reign of  the  conqueror  and  his  two  sons,  and  were  utter  strangers  to  our constitution  as  well  as  our  language.  And  an  accident,  which  soon  after happened,  had  nearly  completed  it's  ruin.  A  copy  of  Justinian's  pandects, being newly discovered at Amal, soon brought the civil law into vogue  all over  the  west  of  Europe,  where  before  it  was  quite  laid  aside  and  in  a manner  forgotten;  though  some  traces  of  it's  authority  remained  in  Italy and  the  eastern  provinces  of  the  empire.  This  now  became  in  a  particular manner  the  favourite  of  the  popish  clergy,  who  borrowed  the  method  and many of the maxims of their canon law from this original. The study of it was introduced  into  several  universities  abroad,  particularly  that  of  Bologna; where  exercises  were  performed,  lectures  read,  and  degrees  conferred  in  this faculty,  as  in  other  branches  of  science:  and  many  nations  on  the  continent, just  then  beginning  to  recover  from  the  convulsions  consequent  upon  the overthrow of the Roman empire, and settling by degrees into peaceable forms of  government,  adopted  the  civil  law,  (being  the  best  written  system  then extant) as the basis of their several constitutions; blending and interweaving it among  their  own  feodal  customs,  in  some  places  with  a  more  extensive,  in others a more confined authority. - 15
- all as antagonistic with religion: banning of teaching clergy law
---
- friction between canon and common law equal to diff between clergy and laity (ordinary people)
- basically goes through the process of development of various laws in this section 
	- specifically with relation to religion
		- and how religion influenced the universities 
	- due to love of civil law, they didn't want to involve common law at all, thus the antagonistic to roman law 
- lack of current education is due from other reasons 
	- long usage very much established custom 
	- ignorance of common law, so civil law was seen as more valuable 
- civil law was gonna die, but something changed 
- incident discussed on page 20: the *physical* consolidation of the court 
	- under Edward I, brought thinkers all together 
	- and made a new university in london, focused on CL and separate from oxford and Cambridge 
		- then Henry III ruined it, forced it out of the city 
- educational system: 
	- inns of cancery
		- more nooby, younger students
	- inns of court
		- more advanced, etc. 
- nobility placed their kids there, all were of higher classes 
	- by Henry VI it became basic practice for young nobility/gentry 
	- but now a lower population in the schools 
		- none in inns of chancery due to anyone being able to go
	- inns of court seen as too specific, not practicable 
	- and rich people don't want to start studying at a new place
	- all issues above are also with the universities 
- basically argues for a lib arts education! 
> The attainment of liberal and genteel accomplishments, though not of the intellectual sort, has been thought by our wisest and most aectionate patrons, and very lately by the whole university, no small improvement of our antient plan of education; and therefore I may safely arm that nothing (how unusual soever) is, under due regulations, improper to be taught in this place, which is proper for a gentleman to learn. But that a science, which distinguishes the criterions of right and wrong; which teaches to establish the one, and prevent, punish, or redress the other; which employs in it's theory the noblest faculties of the soul, and exerts in it's practice the cardinal virtues of the heart; a science, which is universal in it's use and extent, accommodated to each individual, yet comprehending the whole community; that a science like this should have ever been deemed unnecessary to be studied in an university, is matter of astonishment and concern. Surely, if it were not before an object of academical knowlege, it was high time to make it one; and to those who can doubt the propriety of it's reception among us (if any such there be) we may return an answer in their own way; that ethics are confessedly a branch of academical learning, and Aristotle himself has said, speaking of the laws of his own country, that jurisprudence or the knowlege of those laws is the principal and most perfect branch of ethics — 24
- benefactor made a new university 
- legal protections of the universities: 9 of them
	- pages 26-29
- danger of youth 
	- no knowledge of law makes life in general confusion, makes it more difficult to live and do stuff in general
> Making therefore due allowance for one or two shining exceptions, experience may teach us to foretell that a lawyer thus educated to the bar, in subservience to attorneys and solicitors, will nd he has begun at the wrong end. If practice be the whole he is taught, practice must also be the whole he will ever know: if he be uninstructed in the elements and rst principles upon which the rule of practice is founded, the least variation from established precedents will totally distract and bewilder him: ita lex scripta est is the utmost his knowlege will arrive at; he must never aspire to form, and seldom expect to comprehend, any arguments drawn a priori, from the spirit of the laws and the natural foundations of justice.
- keeps talking about the centrality 
- wants these lectures to be read every year! 
	- describes "You will permit me however very brief to describe, rather what I conceive an academical expounder of the laws should do, than what I have ever known to be done."
> He should consider his course as a general map of the law, marking out the shape of the country, it's connexions and boundaries, it's greater divisions and principal cities: it is not his business to describe minutely the subordinate limits, or to x the longitude and latitude of every inconsiderable hamlet. His attention should be engaged, like that of the readers in Fortescue's inns of chancery, "in tracing out the originals and as it were the elements of the law." For if, as Justinian has observed, the tender understanding of the student be loaded at the rst with a multitude and variety of matter, it will either occasion him to desert his studies, or will carry him heavily through them, with much labour, delay, and despondence. These originals should be traced to their fountains, as well as our distance will permit; to the customs of the Britons and Germans, as recorded by Caesar and Tacitus; to the codes of the northern nations on the continent, and more especially to those of our own Saxon princes; to the rules of the Roman law, either left here in the days of Papinian, or imported by Vacarius and his followers; but, above all, to that inexhaustible reservoir of legal antiquities and learning, the feodal law, or, as Spelman has entitled it, the law of nations in our western orb. These primary rules and fundamental principles should be weighed and compared with the precepts of the law of nature, and the practice of other countries; should be explained by reasons, illustrated by examples, and conrmed by undoubted authorities; their history should be deduced, their changes and revolutions observed, and it should be shewn how far they are connected with, or have at any time been affected by, the civil transactions of the kingdom.
- learning the law does take effort, but one can learn the grounds pretty quickly 
- and a big service to the wider society
### section the third: of the laws of england
- two categories of law: unwritten and written
	- *lex non scripta*
		- general (common law) but also particular customs (certain areas) and particular laws (by *custom* only observed in certain areas)
	- *lex scripta*
- *leges non scriptae* /= only oral 
	- **the laws aren't written, but their application is**
> However I therefore stile these parts of our law leges non scriptae, because their original institution and authority are not set down in writing, as acts of parliament are, but they receive their binding power, and the force of laws, by long and immemorial usage, and by their universal reception throughout the kingdom.
- laws deeply bound with language — richer language = better laws 
- again discusses historical connection, the danish invasion on 39
	- but after this the structure of law above of *lex non scripta* was developed 
		- some kind of universal/common law applicable to the entire region
- common law as born from a massive conglomeration of individual, particular laws
	- "Whence it is that in our law the goodness of a custom depends upon it's having been used time out of mind; or, in the solemnity of our legal phrase, time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary. This it is that gives it it's weight and authority; and of this nature are the maxims and customs which compose the common law, or lex non scripta, of this kingdom" — 41
- general customs — aka common law
	- king's court 
	- examples of what it settles, stuff like wills, property, parliament, offences, etc 
		- also creates the structure of lower courts
			- all just depends on immemorial usage — aka common law for support
- common law further cut down: established customs and established rules/maxims
	- blackstone argues these are the same thing
- who knows all this? the judges! 
	- accustomed to the past — holders of history, basically? 
	- they rule:
		- what before was uncertain, and perhaps indifferent, is now become a permanent rule, which it is not in the breast of any subsequent judge to alter or vary from, according to his private sentiments: he being sworn to determine, not according to his own private judgment, but according to the known laws and customs of the land; not delegated to pronounce a new law, but to maintain and expound the old one. Yet this rule admits of exception, where the former determination is most evidently contrary to reason; much more if it be contrary to the divine law. But even in such cases the subsequent judges do not pretend to make a new law, but to vindicate the old one from misrepresentation.
- *law as perfect reason* — what is not reasonable is not law
- thus, doctrine of law: on 44
	- rules and precedents must be followed, unless absurd or unjust:
	- "So that the law, and the opinion of the judge are not always convertible terms, or one and the same thing; since it sometimes may happen that the judge may mistake the law. Upon the whole however, we may take it as a general rule, "that the decisions of courts of justice are the evidence of what is common law:" in the same manner as, in the civil law, what the emperor had once determined was to serve for a guide for the future."
- decisions published publicly, assumed to be fully correct and taken for granted 
- other jurisprudental thinkers also set precedent (see: blackstone himself being cited all the time)
> And thus much for the rest ground and chief corner stone of the laws of England, which is, general immemorial custom, or common law, from time to time declared in the decisions of the courts of justice; which decisions are preserved among our public records, explained in our reports, and digested for general use in the authoritative writings of the venerable sages of the law.
- common law depends on custom
	- and carries internal evidence of freedom, which was *probably* introduced by voluntary consent 
- second branch of *lex non scripta*: particular customs or laws only for certain areas
	- offers some examples — different areas have different needs, so all changes
- rules of "proof" — proof of existence and legality 
- once a custom is proved to exist, must decide if it is good: 
1. long useage
2. continuity of use and right 
	1. short interruption is OK, but if *right* is taken away for even a minute, the custom ends
3. peaceable, consented to
4. reasonable: must not be unreasonable 
5. certainty
6. compulsory, you must do it 
7. consistence across laws — can't be in contradiction
- special customs: 
	- much of *leges non scriptae* only apply to particular *persons* as well districts 
- finally, **peculiar laws, adopted and used only in certain peculiar courts and jurisdictions, aka civil/canon laws** — 52
	- no authority from international laws
		- they only are used domestically when a certain area has accepted it or made it custom 
- links between common and civil laws
- just a bunch of BS on roman laws on 54 
	- again, canon from ecclesiastical law
- CL has power over all of the civil/statute courts 
	- power over all acts of parliament 
	- last resort goes to the court of the king
- versions of statue law: 
	- general (universal rule to all) or special
	- public or private 
- special/private laws are more exceptions than rules 
- also either:
	- declaratory of common law
	- remedial of defects
		- further split into enlarging or restraining 
- rules of construction of statues (60)
	- need to look at old law, mischief, and remedy 
		- how it stood at the making
		- what the mischief (aka failure)
		- what remedy is 
	- can't extend upwards — by general rules 
	- penal must be strictly construed — aka very specific 
	- laws against frauds are to be expounded 
	- the whole must stand, each part must work together
	- a saving is void to the statue "Where the common law and a statue differ, the common law gives place to the statue" - 62
	- repealing: "If a statue, that repeals another, is itself repealed afterwards, the first statue is hereby revived, without any formal words for that purpose" — implicit
	- current parliament cant limit future parliaments
	- acts of parliaments must be **possible** to be acted 
- centrality of equity:
> 	These are the several grounds of the laws of England: over and above which, equity is also frequently called in to assist, to moderate, and to explain it. What equity is, and how impossible in it's very essence to be reduced to stated rules, hath been shewn in the preceding section. I shall therefore only add, that there are courts of this kind established for the benet of the subject, to correct and soften the rigor of the law, when through it's generality it bears too hard in particular cases; to detect and punish latent frauds, which the law is not minute enough to reach; to enforce the execution of such matters of trust and condence, as are binding in conscience, though perhaps not strictly legal; to deliver from such dangers as are owing to misfortune or oversight; and, in short, to relieve in all such cases as are, bona fide, objects of relief. This is the business of our courts of equity, which however are only conversant in matters of property. For the freedom of our constitution will not permit, that in criminal cases a power should be lodged in any judge, to construe the law otherwise than according to the letter. This caution, while it admirably protects the public liberty, can never bear hard upon individuals. A man cannot suer more punishment than the law assigns, but he may suer less. The laws cannot be strained by partiality to inict a penalty beyond what the letter will warrant; but in cases where the letter induces any apparent hardship, the crown has the power to pardon.

## introduction, chapter 1:
### common law, democracy, history: a modernist tradition of reading the past
- common law used widely across the US until end of 19th century
	- very english, judicial so anti-democratic, etc. 
- kent quote on 1-2
	- CL as very wide, fills space that statute law can't fill
	- it's another language we must learn
- so why it was used in the US:
	- ideological freight — hard to imagine a US constitution without CL at the time
	- US state played less of a role before the 20th — so big gap in economy and society 
- 19th c.: imagining how democracy, CL, history can coexist:
	- "They reveal different conceptions of how law, history, and democracy related to one another, different modes of historicizing law, and different ways of thinking about history itself." — 3
- modernist tradition of these aspects has covered up understanding CL
	- so must understand modernist les before we understand CL
- in end of 19th/early 20th century, focus changed — economy, industry, capital
	- won over democracy, etc. 
- case in 1905 — Lochner v New York, labour hour case (mentioned in scalia?)
	- read CL freedoms into 14th amendment
	- symbol of judicial overreach
- "Progressive Era" — people critiqued the use of CL witthin it 
	- CL as retreating at the New Deal
- for democracy to "win," law had to be a species of politics 
- characteristics of modernism: pg 5
	- all results in an erosion between law and politics 
		- through a reflection of history — gets rid of moralistic, logical, suprahistorical foundations
		- Holmes saw CL as "insensitive" to history
			- law as "experience" not logic
> 				But the common law, Holmes suggested, was ultimately irreducible to logic. Logic was not its foundation. Like all law, the common law had to be seen, instead, as the product of nothing but history, as something that had arisen and developed in time, as something without ahistorical foundations
- also, CL as repeating the past for no reason
- for law to be just, it had to be just in the present as a matter of self-reflection — can't just be blindly looking at the past 
	- various aspects of CL — logic and precedent oriented
		- logic was newer, precedent was much older
> 			What unifies Holmes’s twin critiques of the common law is his mod ernist conception of history. For Holmes, history is the heretical or icon oclastic practice of revealing the merely temporal origins of phenomena in order to dismantle the foundations upon which such phenomena rest, whether those foundations be the logic allegedly underlying law or the accumulated weight of law’s past that authorizes its own repetition. Once the temporal origins of phenomena have been identified and their foun dations undermined, however, no underlying order, instantiated in an unfolding historical time, becomes visible. In other words, history pos sesses no necessary or coherent direction or meaning. It simply sweeps away foundations, clears ground, and invites self-reflection. Law’s foun dations may be dismantled in the name of history, but we are given no substitute foundations. We are told to think about what we might want law to be. — 7
- logic could be used against democracy, but his focus was on law more so
	- if law is based temporally, how does one distinguish between law+politics? 
- Holmes helped get rid of the idea that legal thought independent of politics and separate from society — pushed into  20th century
	- law began to move into the "present"
	- idea of law as a science, necessitating scientific methods and materials, etc. 
- argues that the erosion btwn law and politics has become authoritative, traditionalist
	- a feeling that CL was overreaching, looking from a modernist view
- looking back to pragmatism — looking at how principles change over time
	- but taking this view makes it harder to look at the past, makes it seem like a random collection of decisions, hard to figure out definitions and relations of things
- look to the world *before* the modernist reconstruction, helps understand CL more
	- and applicable to today!
### nineteenth century common law thought
> In order to begin exploring the relationships among democracy, law, and history before modernism, one has to distance oneself from one of the critical assumptions of modernist historical thought, namely that an iconoclastic dismantling of the foundations of phenomena through the technique of revealing their temporal origins will clear ground, enable critical self-reflection, and open up the world for reimagining and remaking. — 11
- lets us imagine the subject as fully blank, unconstrained, unencumbered
- 19th c had a lot of real restraints
	- fall of religiousness in society as a reason CL weakened? 
	- the kinds of imagined limits and interactions between them are what is vital! 
- concept of democracy was new — still very suspicious
	- i.e. checks and balances system in the constitution
	- Carlyle: imagining that nature sets conditions with set limits on democracy
- limits of democracy as very "normal"
	- but people still aware of the issues in the 19th c democracy, what was happening overseas
	- and the incompatibilities felt like restraints? 
- two ways in which time was seen in political democracy: 
	- nonhistorical premodern times of CL
	- changing teleological and foundational times of 19th century
- changes the view of holmes, makes it seem less tyrannical!
- FIRST TIME: CL seen as ahistorical, "immemorial" 
	- which was seen as a claim for legitemacy
	- but both unchanging and always changing
		- but the idea was that the changes were so slow nobody noticed them happening! 
			- less coersive, violent, upsetting? 
	- all this gave CL its authority! the long past
	- idea was that when the CL judge spoke, it was perfectly mirroring the actual state of the community at the time
		- seen as a balance of past, present, futute
- SECOND TIME: history as a series of phenomenons, one leading to the next
	- logic of law was difficult to ascertain 
	- highly complex world, getting more so
	- and a more negative view of the past — 18th/19th century americans were too exceptionalist:
> 			Even as many in the nineteenth century saw democracy as furnishing the logic of his tory, to the extent that history was imagined to possess an underlying logic and meaning and direction, it could equally serve as a check on democracy. If history was going somewhere, in other words, it was possible to judge the activities of a democratically elected legislature in terms of that logic. Thus judged, a legislature could be “wrong” in the sense that it was guilty of flouting the logic of history.
- example of slavery: 
	- looking at history as the law — thus changing is an exception, against the logic (past events and precedents)
	- both in pro and anti-slavery, democracy was limited by the logic applied to history 
- turn to history in the overall time gave much more power to the CL 
- how 19th c lawyers combined CL and historical sensibilities: 
	- turned to CL to "understand" any issues facing them
	- not quite seen as good or bad, but a tradition of general thought 
		- time, law, society, government, etc. 
	- but many different understandings and conceptions of history 
		- subjecting the CL to history as a move frmo feudal to commercial 
- issues of democracy began to appear in mid-19th century — state regulation, slavery, etc. 
- judgement of CL in terms of logic and vocabulary of history
- anti-foundational modernist history let us see law as subject to reform
	- as they did in the 19th c, but from a POV where history was foundational and had inherent logic 
- both are ways to see history — but both don't work, like modernism
- a reflexive relationship between history and CL
	- 19th c CL as being in both nonmodern CL and modern 19th c history 
		- not an easy task to do! 
- CL as surviving due to all the constant change at the time! and central to the time's development
- CL lawyers could argue that when CL is joined with history, you can see that CL courts are better at seeing what the society wants 
- wider breakdown resulted in new ways to look at history, the state, etc.
### structure of book, aka general argument
- difference between 19th and 20th c legal thought is very similar 
	- different, but both useful 
- a history *of* history: 
> To be sure, identifying the “dominant” historical imagination for any given period is fraught with perils. Over the course of the nineteenth cen tury, there were many ways of conceiving of the movement of history. Each of the periods I identify contains many different historical logics, some pointing backward to earlier periods, others anticipating future periods, yet others simply different from one another. Each period, in other words, is inevitably complex. One would expect no less. The point of identifying a period for me, then, is not to make an argument about periods, but to identify a historical imagination, unarguably influential at a particular time, and to show how it was shared, appropriated, and ~o transformed by legal thinkers. My technique has been to work back from E the principal legal texts, to rely upon the historical imagination of legal thinkers as a guide to reconstructing the historical imagination of any given period. — 24

## chapter 3: common law thought after the american revolution
### the loneliness of consent
---
### conclusion
- non-historicality of CL like immemoriality and insensibility — mysterious 
	- only legislature can make law
- but how did CL thinkers see a future for CL in the US 
> We have already seen that American common law thinkers imagined the common law to be a method of effecting the movement of history even as they subjected the English common law to history. At the same time, they were able to argue that the common law was, as the most consensual of all laws, perfectly consistent with America’s experimental, consent-based polities. But did this emphasis on the consensual nature of the common law mean that American common law thinkers were receptive to the proliferation of local customs in America?
- over time, local customs grew 
	- but generally, distaste for them — BOTH from Federalists and pro-CL thinkers
	- wanted to concentrate power to declare the customs in the hands of CL judge 
		- a homogeneous landscape
- but the idea of a "clean sate" 
---

### lecture I
- title: *Common-Law Courts in a Civil-Law System: The Role of the United States Federal Courts in Interpreting the Constitution and Laws*
- about the the issues in legal education with regard to the educational system
- self-described as textualist/originalist
- have to learn how to "think" like a lawyer — first year of law schooL!
- common law is not "common" — not customary law
	- developed by the judges, common for them? 
	- only sense that it is "common" is in the way the doctrine of *stare decis* is custom 
		- rather, past judicial decisions as custom
- image of CL as held by many as through Holmes
- centrality of case-law method: 
	- scalia uses the example of the crank-shaft from over a century and a half ago
	- links to liability! 
- old cases are famous "not because they came out right, but because the rule of law they announced was the intelligent one" — 6
- two functions of CL courts:
	- apply the law to the facts
	- more importantly: *make* the law
- bunch of discursive talk on liability — good if I have to write about pfalsgraf? 
- first-year of law school as playing as a CL judge — teaching the skill of *distinguishing cases*
	- necessary due to doctrine of *stare decis*
- in civil law systems: prior decisions are consulted for persuasive effect, are not binding
	- in CL, the principle of a previous decision makes it a legal rule, must be held in future cases!
> 	In the strictest sense, the holding of a decision cannot go beyond the facts that were before the court. 
- but then question of facts and such arise! 
- CL as growing like a scrabble board — 8
- this way of understanding law is how the american student first learns
	- mentions holmes and cardozo! 
	- in this way, CL is carried on via education
---
- all well and good, except for democracy
- difficult relationship, evidenced by Federalist 47, Madison
- movement in 19th c against CL
	- failed, but seen in civil procedure and civil cases
	- CL seen as ex post facto, and over-distillation of reason!
- old private-law feilds (tort, contract, property, family law) still remain within common law
	- even more freewheeling, less stare decis 
---
- scalia sees CL as OK, and works with democracy? 
	- but dislikes the attitude of CL judges: thinking what is the *desireable* outcome
		- thinks of what he wants the outcome to be before actually arguing for it 
	- scalia does this! 
- no such thing as CL in federal law — everything he does is *interpreting the text*
	- note: constitution makes up a very small part of this — scalia says less than a fifth, even less w/ criminal law
- saying CL isn't consistent is pointless, statue law is also inconsistent!
	- as quoted from Hard and Sacks, pg. 13
- generally low interest in the analysis of statute law, but there was way more interest in the past
- basic question: **what are we looking for when we construe a statue?**
	- some say it is "intent" — thanks to blackstone
		- but then, how far do we go? floor debates? difference btwn what was *said* vs *intended*?
> 			We do not really look for subjective legislative intent.We look for a sort of "objectified" intent — the intent that a reasonable person would gather from the text of the law, placed alongside the remainder of the corpus Juris — 16
- it is the *law* that governs, not the intent of the lawmaker, listening to intent as tyrannical
	- everything thus must go back to the text — a government of laws, not of men
- but then raises the other issue: practically, CL judges will pursue own objectives into statutory field
	- thinking about that it *meant* leads to thinking what you a reasonable person *should* have meant
- gives example of "legislative intent" winning over law: Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States — 17,18
- congress can enact whatever statues they want — btu it is not for the courts to decide
- not all see judicial law-making as bad
	- could keep law from falling into obscelesence?
- scalia agrees with calabresi and eskridge: "not only what the statue means abstractly, or evenon the basis of legislative history, but also what it ought to mean in terms of the needs and goals of our present day society."
- but this needs to be removed, not compatible with democratic theory, judges are unelected! 
- Trinity v US as wrong because it failed to follow text:
	- "The text is the law, and it is the text that that must be observed."
- doesn't care what the intent was, only what the statute means
- textualism /= strict constructivism:
> 		Textualism should not be confused with so-called strict constructionism, which is a degraded form of textualism that brings the whole philosophy into disrepute. I am not a strict constructionist, and no one ought to be- though better that, I suppose, than a nontextualist. A text should not be construed strictly, and it should not be construed leniently; it should be construed reasonably, to contain all that it fairly means. — 22
- but a textualist isn't a nihilist — a balance
- also accused of being formalistic: *but that's the point!*
- =="Long live formalism. It is what makes a government a government of laws and not of men." — 24==
### lecture II
- discussing statutory interpretation, especially with constitutional texts
- related to *canons of construction* — generally disliked! 
	-  a lot of disagreement within legal thinkers about it, some canons are "accepted," others aren't 
	- just shows one indication of meaning — some are even contradictory, right? 
- similarly, use of presumptions and *rules* of construction that emphasise a certain result over another
- textualists HATE this one simple trick! 
- everything is ambiguous — complains about it on 27
- whether or not this "dice-loading" is good or bad, question is really does a court have the right to impose them — nope
	- some would argue that the rules would be found in normal interpretation anyway
---
- discussion of legislative history in interpreting statues — from 28
- traditionally, only the text is looked at, never the intent of the legislature:
- good quote from Justice Taney, 1845:
> 	In expounding this law, the judgment of the court cannot, in any degree, be influenced by the construction placed upon it by individual members of Congress in the debate which took place on its passage, nor by the motives or reasons assigned by them for supporting or opposing amendments that were offered. The law as it passed is the will of the majority of both houses, and the only mode in which that will is spoken is in the act itself; and we must gather their intention from the language there used, comparing it, when any ambiguity exists, with the laws upon the same subject, and looking, if necessary, to the public history of the times in which it was passed. — 28
- legislative history as used in courts is kinda new — only originating in the 1940s! still highly criticised even in the 50s
	- Jackson in 53 did, quote on 105
- but commonly used today — "Congress said X" can mean the law *or more often,* what was said in a single committee report, etc. 
	- statutory language seen as the *backup* when intent can't be found or is unclear
- use of legislative history doesn't even make sense for those who DO use it! 
	- most of the time, no intent to be found whatsoever! plus, very small amounts 
	- massive system now, floor is rarely crowded, not even the legislators know what the fuck is going on like ever 
- funny quote: 31/32 on writing committee reports!
	- "discipline ourselves to the task of expressing congressional intent in the statute"
		- intent as found within *the specific text of the statute, not in the other shit — just the TEXT*
- once upon a time, there was interest in the *history* of the law — development, persuasion, etc. 
	- but now just look at debates and committee reports seen as super authoritative 
	- even a target for lobbyists! 
- just because the legislators don't understand the law doesn't mean it's not valid 
	- a bill passing with a majority WITH OR WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING makes it a law
> 		"All legislative Powers herein granted," the Constitution says, "shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives." The legislative power is the power to make laws, not the power to make legislators. It is nondelegable. Congress can no more authorize one committee to "fill in the details" of a particular law in a binding fashion than it can authorize a committee to enact minor laws. Whatever Congress has not itself prescribed is left to be resolved by the executive or (ultimately) the judicial branch. That is the very essence of the separation of powers. The only conceivable basis for considering committee reports authoritative, therefore, is that they are a genuine indication of the will of the entire house- which, as I have been at pains to explain, they assuredly are not. — 33-4
- if reports and such did show intent, fine, but THEY DON'T! 
	- just have made using legislative history worse
		- massive playing feild, on top of canons of construction
	- way too varied for actual use
- and not using it would save so many resources! 
	- estimates ~60% lawyers on his staff were looking over legislative history! literally pointless
---
- finally, ==constitutional intent==
- good quote from Marshall: 
> A constitution, to contain an accurate detail of all the subdivisions of which its great powers will admit, and of all the means by which they may be carried into execution, would partake of the prolixity of a legal code, and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind. It would probably never be understood by the public. Its nature, therefore, requires, that only its great outlines should be marked, its important objects designated, and the minor ingredients which compose the objects be deduced from the nature of the objects themselves. — 35
- expansive, rather than narrow interpretation
	- but not so wide the text can't hold it! 
- example with the first amendment on 36
	- doesn't cover every kind of speech possible
- same thing as common law — concept of a living constitution
	- unlike statutes, it grows and changes 
	- and judges find those changing laws! 
		- ask what the result *ought* to be, and then distinguishing/overruling cases to get there
- far too common law, not democratic
	- so he's arguing for textualism
- distinguishes between statutes and constitutions — formally treated as a common law
- pragmatically argued that the approach is needed for flexibility and allowing the const to "grow" for current times
	- this is wrong, historically — the const. is shrinking, addition of constraints
	- lists some of those restraints on 39
		- "The Living Constitution does not seek to facilitate social change but to prevent it." — 40
		- a *few* exceptions, but even those are mostly reductions — but we see them as "good," so we ignore it 
- ==another example: the case with the traumatised girl==
	- SUPER good for stuff on trauma:
		- > Or if property rights are too cold to get your juices flowing, and the right to bear arms too dangerous, let me give another example: Several terms ago a case came before the Supreme Court involving a prosecution for sexual abuse of a young child. The trial court found that the child would be too frightened to testify in the presence of the (presumed) abuser, and so, pursuant to state law, she was permitted to testify with only the prosecutor and defense counsel present, the defendant, the judge, and the jury watching over closed-circuit television. A reasonable enough procedure, and it was held to be constitutional by my Court. 32 I dissented, because the Sixth Amendment provides that "in all criminal prosecutions" (let me ernhpasize the word "all") "the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him." There is no doubt what confrontation meant -or indeed means today. It means face-to-face, not watching from another room. And there is no doubt what one of the major purposes of that provision was: to induce precisely that pressure upon the witness which the little girl found it difficult to endure. It is difficult to accuse someone to his face, particularly when you are lying. Now no extrinsic factors have changed since that provision was adopted in 1791. Sexual abuse existed then, as it does now; little children were more easily upset than adults, then as now; a means of placing the defendant out of sight of the witness existed then as now (a screen could easily have been erected that would enable the defendant to see the witness, but not the witness the defendant). But the Sixth Amendment nonetheless gave all criminal defendants the right to confront the witnesses against them, because that was thought to be an important protection. The only significant thing that has changed, I think, is the society's sensitivity to so-called psychic trauma (which is what we are told the child witness in such a situation suffers) and the society's assessment of where the proper balance ought to be struck between the two extremes of a procedure that assures convicting 100 percent of all child abusers, and a procedure that assures acquitting 100 percent of those who have been falsely accused of child abuse. I have no doubt that the society is, as a whole, happy and pleased with what my Court decided. But we should not pretend that the decision did not eliminate a liberty that previously existed.
	- also raises that living constitutionalists don't follow any kind of course or desires — totally random? 
		- a very fracturing debate, lotsa issues
- originalists, ofc, don't agree either ‚ but they at least know what they're looking for
	- yeah, disagree on what the meaning *is*, but they're all looking for the meaning!
- explicitness is ignore! 
	- i.e. justices who say death penalty is unconstitutional despite it being *explicitly* in the constitution!
- interpretation of the constitution as lawyer's work 
	- examination, history, understanding, precedent
- but b/c constitution is seen as different, people look at what it *should* mean
	- results in bias, people looking to find people who agree with them, just results in politicising the judicial process, no? 
- wider public now believes in a living constitution
	- if the courts could rewrite the constitution, they would write it as the majority want!
- ending quote: 
> As I said at the outset of these lectures, the interpretation and application of democratically adopted texts comprises virtually all the work of federal judges, and the vast majority of the work of state judges, in New Jersey and elsewhere. I have tried to explain why, in my view, we common lawyers come to the bench ill prepared for that task -indeed, even ill disposed towards that task. I have discussed a few principles of statutory interpretation that seem to me the most basic or the most currently in need of emphasis. That part was principally of interest to the lawyers among you. And finally, I have discussed the major issue of textual interpretation posed by that peculiar type of text known as a constitution. These last remarks were not distinctively lawyers' or judges' business, but the business of every intelligent citizen; for as I have explained, if the people misunderstand the nature of the Constitution, and the role of the courts in its enforcement, the enterprise cannot succeed.
