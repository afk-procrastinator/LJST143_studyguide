Hayden White: the value of narrativity
1. Narrativity is deeply human, we use narrative to communicate and we find familiarity in it, even when we do not share a language
2. Difference between an annal, a chronicle, and a full history
	1. Annals are just a list of events, without possibility or the info you need to derive true meaning, whereas a chronicle starts to do so, without the final conclusion that sort of marks a history
	2. With annals, we lack the question of who, or the significance of literally anything
	3. There's a need to rank events, and that is part of what grants them meaning
3. Narrativity is utilized in order to create a cohesive story when  cohesive story does not necessarily exist; it is only through this that we can derive some kind of meaning/moral from them
4. The moral historical account is presented as an objective thing, but quite frankly it isn't
5. it is a construction that seeks to create that 
Palsgraf: 
1. Quintessential thing for torts law
2. basic question here is where liability lies in this case; is it the fault of the railroad company or is no one at fault and is it really just somewhat unfortunate 
3. Determines what is legally a wrong, and what isn't 
4. Defines negligence, which is then used as precedent case for a lot of other torts cases
Noonan: 
1. Different ways of characterizing people, omission/inclusion of certain facts and identifiers have the ability to alter the nature of the case (for example, including gender or name to humanize versus excluding to make it feel less personal)
2. nature of the accident, background like what kind of wrong this was, who was the jury and who was the judge in this case, all of these factors combine to create a unique understanding of the case
3. There's also the goal of creating a unanimous or seemingly obvious conclusion 
4. Same as what Ferguson mentions
Ferguson
1. Monologic voice: courtroom discourse inevitably will require some kind of focus on spoken words 
2. Judicial voice tries to amalgamate al other voices into one, it must speak entirely for itself, and has no other choice
3. justices can highlight the importance of the decisions they're making
4. monologic voice seeks an absolute identity between character and text
5. Interrogative mode
6. The question that judges use as the basis of their deliberations
7. Each court makes a fundamental decision about what question they're actually trying to answer essentially, with that controlling all other questions in the case
8. Basically, how we ask the questions that we seek to answer is more important than the theories that we propose in answering those questions
9. Cases can be overturned merely by restating or altering the problem at hand, which in turn fundamentally changes the case at hand
10. Declarative tone: driven by this tone, works toward certitude 
11. Raises complexities only to dismiss them in a decisive act of judgment
12. announce rather than explain the Court's faith in its ability to handle the problems at hand 
13. succeeds because of a series of implicit assumptions about the meaning of an event in a judicial decision, assigning meaning in some way
14. Judicial opinion appropriates, molds, and condenses that transcript in a far more cohesive narrative of judgment, one that gives the possibility of final interpretation by turning original event into a legal incident for judgment 
15. Rhetoric of inevitability 
16. Build together in what might be called a rhetoric of inevitability, that is to say, that the majority opinion reaches a conclusion that cannot be avoided
17. Uses reason and a belief in measured form to articulate and justify the hold of the past over the present 
18. Generic impulses in the judicial opinion can lead to better appreciation of the skills and creativity in such writing
# blackstone:
- big chonk info 
### section the first: on the study of law
- about... the study of law! wow! 
- sees law as a "science"
- looks down on EU unis lol
- civil law as a "collection of written reason" (2)
	- but an awareness of our past failures is also necessary
- young people should be educated early about their laws and constitutions 
- law as useful everywhere in life
	- speaks through an example — obliquely about England? 
	- private property
		- importance of knowing law in order to protect oneself and one's property 
	- also: wills and testaments
		- importance for future events as well, aka death
	- also also: serving on juries 
- need to know law for day-to-day behaviour and interactions with others
> 	"Else,  when  he  has  mistaken  his  authority,  through  passion, through  ignorance,  or  absurdity,  he  will  be  the  object  of  contempt  from  his inferiors,  and  of  censure  from  those  to  whom  he  is  accountable  for  his conduct." -6  
- even more so in political representation
	- they are the "guardians" of the constitution
	- and duh, they need an understanding and knowledge of the land! 
- people don't see law as needing "apprenticeships"
	- assumed as some kind of natural right or ability 
- highly pro-common law 
	- places any blame of it's misuse on statute law! 
		- best to learn via experience — more and more knowledge is necessary
- higher the judge, the higher the stakes 
- references roman history a bit - 9
- knowledge of laww still highly useful for "learned" professions, now just judges and lawyers
	- applicability to the entirety of law and life - 10
	- same with those in religious and maritime — even if there's a small chance it's applicable, it needs to be understood!
> 		 In which  we  are  not  singular  in  our  notions;  for  even  in  Holland, where  the  imperial  law  is  much  cultivated  and  it's  decisions  pretty  generally followed, we are informed by Van Leeuwen[i],  that, "it receives  it's force from custom  and  the  consent  of  the  people,  either  tacitly  or  expressly  given:  for otherwise, he adds, we should no more be bound by this law, than by that of the Almains, the Franks, the Saxons, the Goths, the Vandals, and other of the antient  nations." - 11  
- but this whole study hasn't been appreciated in universities! 
	- looks back in time — relates to the use of multiple languages in universities 
	- historicity of it: p14
- CL's value as coming from it **not being written at all**:
> 	BUt the  common  law  of  England,  being  not  committed  to  writing,  but only  handed  down  by  tradition,  use,  and  experience,  was  not  so  heartily relished by the foreign clergy; who came over hither in shoals during the reign of  the  conqueror  and  his  two  sons,  and  were  utter  strangers  to  our constitution  as  well  as  our  language.  And  an  accident,  which  soon  after happened,  had  nearly  completed  it's  ruin.  A  copy  of  Justinian's  pandects, being newly discovered at Amal, soon brought the civil law into vogue  all over  the  west  of  Europe,  where  before  it  was  quite  laid  aside  and  in  a manner  forgotten;  though  some  traces  of  it's  authority  remained  in  Italy and  the  eastern  provinces  of  the  empire.  This  now  became  in  a  particular manner  the  favourite  of  the  popish  clergy,  who  borrowed  the  method  and many of the maxims of their canon law from this original. The study of it was introduced  into  several  universities  abroad,  particularly  that  of  Bologna; where  exercises  were  performed,  lectures  read,  and  degrees  conferred  in  this faculty,  as  in  other  branches  of  science:  and  many  nations  on  the  continent, just  then  beginning  to  recover  from  the  convulsions  consequent  upon  the overthrow of the Roman empire, and settling by degrees into peaceable forms of  government,  adopted  the  civil  law,  (being  the  best  written  system  then extant) as the basis of their several constitutions; blending and interweaving it among  their  own  feodal  customs,  in  some  places  with  a  more  extensive,  in others a more confined authority. - 15  
- all as antagonistic with religion: banning of teaching clergy law
- - - -
- friction between canon and common law equal to diff between clergy and laity (ordinary people)
- basically goes through the process of development of various laws in this section 
	- specifically with relation to religion
		- and how religion influenced the universities 
	- due to love of civil law, they didn't want to involve common law at all, thus the antagonistic to roman law 
- lack of current education is due from other reasons 
	- long usage very much established custom 
	- ignorance of common law, so civil law was seen as more valuable 
- civil law was gonna die, but something changed 
- incident discussed on page 20: the *physical* consolidation of the court 
	- under Edward I, brought thinkers all together 
	- and made a new university in london, focused on CL and separate from oxford and Cambridge 
		- then Henry III ruined it, forced it out of the city 
- educational system: 
	- inns of cancery
		- more nooby, younger students
	- inns of court
		- more advanced, etc. 
- nobility placed their kids there, all were of higher classes 
	- by Henry VI it became basic practice for young nobility/gentry 
	- but now a lower population in the schools 
		- none in inns of chancery due to anyone being able to go
	- inns of court seen as too specific, not practicable 
	- and rich people don't want to start studying at a new place
	- all issues above are also with the universities 
- basically argues for a lib arts education! 
> The attainment of liberal and genteel accomplishments, though not of the intellectual sort, has been thought by our wisest and most aectionate patrons, and very lately by the whole university, no small improvement of our antient plan of education; and therefore I may safely arm that nothing (how unusual soever) is, under due regulations, improper to be taught in this place, which is proper for a gentleman to learn. But that a science, which distinguishes the criterions of right and wrong; which teaches to establish the one, and prevent, punish, or redress the other; which employs in it's theory the noblest faculties of the soul, and exerts in it's practice the cardinal virtues of the heart; a science, which is universal in it's use and extent, accommodated to each individual, yet comprehending the whole community; that a science like this should have ever been deemed unnecessary to be studied in an university, is matter of astonishment and concern. Surely, if it were not before an object of academical knowlege, it was high time to make it one; and to those who can doubt the propriety of it's reception among us (if any such there be) we may return an answer in their own way; that ethics are confessedly a branch of academical learning, and Aristotle himself has said, speaking of the laws of his own country, that jurisprudence or the knowlege of those laws is the principal and most perfect branch of ethics — 24  
- benefactor made a new university 
- legal protections of the universities: 9 of them
	- pages 26-29
- danger of youth 
	- no knowledge of law makes life in general confusion, makes it more difficult to live and do stuff in general
> Making therefore due allowance for one or two shining exceptions, experience may teach us to foretell that a lawyer thus educated to the bar, in subservience to attorneys and solicitors, will nd he has begun at the wrong end. If practice be the whole he is taught, practice must also be the whole he will ever know: if he be uninstructed in the elements and rst principles upon which the rule of practice is founded, the least variation from established precedents will totally distract and bewilder him: ita lex scripta est is the utmost his knowlege will arrive at; he must never aspire to form, and seldom expect to comprehend, any arguments drawn a priori, from the spirit of the laws and the natural foundations of justice.  
- keeps talking about the centrality 
- wants these lectures to be read every year! 
	- describes "You will permit me however very brief to describe, rather what I conceive an academical expounder of the laws should do, than what I have ever known to be done."
> He should consider his course as a general map of the law, marking out the shape of the country, it's connexions and boundaries, it's greater divisions and principal cities: it is not his business to describe minutely the subordinate limits, or to x the longitude and latitude of every inconsiderable hamlet. His attention should be engaged, like that of the readers in Fortescue's inns of chancery, "in tracing out the originals and as it were the elements of the law." For if, as Justinian has observed, the tender understanding of the student be loaded at the rst with a multitude and variety of matter, it will either occasion him to desert his studies, or will carry him heavily through them, with much labour, delay, and despondence. These originals should be traced to their fountains, as well as our distance will permit; to the customs of the Britons and Germans, as recorded by Caesar and Tacitus; to the codes of the northern nations on the continent, and more especially to those of our own Saxon princes; to the rules of the Roman law, either left here in the days of Papinian, or imported by Vacarius and his followers; but, above all, to that inexhaustible reservoir of legal antiquities and learning, the feodal law, or, as Spelman has entitled it, the law of nations in our western orb. These primary rules and fundamental principles should be weighed and compared with the precepts of the law of nature, and the practice of other countries; should be explained by reasons, illustrated by examples, and conrmed by undoubted authorities; their history should be deduced, their changes and revolutions observed, and it should be shewn how far they are connected with, or have at any time been affected by, the civil transactions of the kingdom.  
- learning the law does take effort, but one can learn the grounds pretty quickly 
- and a big service to the wider society
### section the third: of the laws of england
- two categories of law: unwritten and written
	- *lex non scripta*
		- general (common law) but also particular customs (certain areas) and particular laws (by *custom* only observed in certain areas)
	- *lex scripta*
- *leges non scriptae* /= only oral 
	- **the laws aren't written, but their application is**
> However I therefore stile these parts of our law leges non scriptae, because their original institution and authority are not set down in writing, as acts of parliament are, but they receive their binding power, and the force of laws, by long and immemorial usage, and by their universal reception throughout the kingdom.  
- laws deeply bound with language — richer language = better laws 
- again discusses historical connection, the danish invasion on 39
	- but after this the structure of law above of *lex non scripta* was developed 
		- some kind of universal/common law applicable to the entire region
- common law as born from a massive conglomeration of individual, particular laws
	- "Whence it is that in our law the goodness of a custom depends upon it's having been used time out of mind; or, in the solemnity of our legal phrase, time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary. This it is that gives it it's weight and authority; and of this nature are the maxims and customs which compose the common law, or lex non scripta, of this kingdom" — 41
- general customs — aka common law
	- king's court 
	- examples of what it settles, stuff like wills, property, parliament, offences, etc 
		- also creates the structure of lower courts
			- all just depends on immemorial usage — aka common law for support
- common law further cut down: established customs and established rules/maxims
	- blackstone argues these are the same thing
- who knows all this? the judges! 
	- accustomed to the past — holders of history, basically? 
	- they rule:
		- what before was uncertain, and perhaps indifferent, is now become a permanent rule, which it is not in the breast of any subsequent judge to alter or vary from, according to his private sentiments: he being sworn to determine, not according to his own private judgment, but according to the known laws and customs of the land; not delegated to pronounce a new law, but to maintain and expound the old one. Yet this rule admits of exception, where the former determination is most evidently contrary to reason; much more if it be contrary to the divine law. But even in such cases the subsequent judges do not pretend to make a new law, but to vindicate the old one from misrepresentation.
- *law as perfect reason* — what is not reasonable is not law
- thus, doctrine of law: on 44
	- rules and precedents must be followed, unless absurd or unjust:
	- "So that the law, and the opinion of the judge are not always convertible terms, or one and the same thing; since it sometimes may happen that the judge may mistake the law. Upon the whole however, we may take it as a general rule, "that the decisions of courts of justice are the evidence of what is common law:" in the same manner as, in the civil law, what the emperor had once determined was to serve for a guide for the future."
- decisions published publicly, assumed to be fully correct and taken for granted 
- other jurisprudental thinkers also set precedent (see: blackstone himself being cited all the time)
> And thus much for the rest ground and chief corner stone of the laws of England, which is, general immemorial custom, or common law, from time to time declared in the decisions of the courts of justice; which decisions are preserved among our public records, explained in our reports, and digested for general use in the authoritative writings of the venerable sages of the law.  
- common law depends on custom
	- and carries internal evidence of freedom, which was *probably* introduced by voluntary consent 
- second branch of *lex non scripta*: particular customs or laws only for certain areas
	- offers some examples — different areas have different needs, so all changes
- rules of "proof" — proof of existence and legality 
- once a custom is proved to exist, must decide if it is good: 
1. long useage
2. continuity of use and right 
	1. short interruption is OK, but if *right* is taken away for even a minute, the custom ends
3. peaceable, consented to
4. reasonable: must not be unreasonable 
5. certainty
6. compulsory, you must do it 
7. consistence across laws — can't be in contradiction
- special customs: 
	- much of *leges non scriptae* only apply to particular *persons* as well districts 
- finally, **peculiar laws, adopted and used only in certain peculiar courts and jurisdictions, aka civil/canon laws** — 52
	- no authority from international laws
		- they only are used domestically when a certain area has accepted it or made it custom 
- links between common and civil laws
- just a bunch of BS on roman laws on 54 
	- again, canon from ecclesiastical law
- CL has power over all of the civil/statute courts 
	- power over all acts of parliament 
	- last resort goes to the court of the king
- versions of statue law: 
	- general (universal rule to all) or special
	- public or private 
- special/private laws are more exceptions than rules 
- also either:
	- declaratory of common law
	- remedial of defects
		- further split into enlarging or restraining 
- rules of construction of statues (60)
	- need to look at old law, mischief, and remedy 
		- how it stood at the making
		- what the mischief (aka failure)
		- what remedy is 
	- can't extend upwards — by general rules 
	- penal must be strictly construed — aka very specific 
	- laws against frauds are to be expounded 
	- the whole must stand, each part must work together
	- a saving is void to the statue "Where the common law and a statue differ, the common law gives place to the statue" - 62
	- repealing: "If a statue, that repeals another, is itself repealed afterwards, the first statue is hereby revived, without any formal words for that purpose" — implicit
	- current parliament cant limit future parliaments
	- acts of parliaments must be **possible** to be acted 
- centrality of equity:
> 	These are the several grounds of the laws of England: over and above which, equity is also frequently called in to assist, to moderate, and to explain it. What equity is, and how impossible in it's very essence to be reduced to stated rules, hath been shewn in the preceding section. I shall therefore only add, that there are courts of this kind established for the benet of the subject, to correct and soften the rigor of the law, when through it's generality it bears too hard in particular cases; to detect and punish latent frauds, which the law is not minute enough to reach; to enforce the execution of such matters of trust and condence, as are binding in conscience, though perhaps not strictly legal; to deliver from such dangers as are owing to misfortune or oversight; and, in short, to relieve in all such cases as are, bona fide, objects of relief. This is the business of our courts of equity, which however are only conversant in matters of property. For the freedom of our constitution will not permit, that in criminal cases a power should be lodged in any judge, to construe the law otherwise than according to the letter. This caution, while it admirably protects the public liberty, can never bear hard upon individuals. A man cannot suer more punishment than the law assigns, but he may suer less. The laws cannot be strained by partiality to inict a penalty beyond what the letter will warrant; but in cases where the letter induces any apparent hardship, the crown has the power to pardon.  

Parker: 
1. Common law came with heavy ideological freight, as in it had resisted the encroachments of would-be absolute monarchs in the name of England's ancient common law freedoms - the US had absorbed this readily
2. 1900, the popularity of common law had started to fade slightly
3. Progressive era led to a heavy assault on the common law tradition, as people sought to restore democratic majorities as the main legislative force
4. Some argued that common law was too insensitive to history
5. Common law was excessively wedded to repeating the past for its own sake - these critiques are seemingly incompatible 
6. Common law was hailed as something that could respond to changing circumstances through recourse 
7. Common law traditions could not have survived in the way it did had it not been constantly updated, and readapted for different 
8. Americans were shifting towards the less artificial and the more natural and visible forms of food
9. Wanted to make law more easily accessible 
10. Denounces hereditary monarchy, and argued that all law had to be the product of a subject who had the ability to consent 
11. Common law could be compared to inheritance in a way, which is a comparison that I like a lot actually
12. Paine believed that all parties needed to have the ability to act for itself in all cases, without being affected by generations that came before it
13. Some argued that the US were better because they had these written fundamental rights, but others actually argued otherwise, saying that there was no difference considering they had stemmed from the same place
14. Written law was supplemented in many ways by unwritten law, namely taht of common law
15. Supreme Court hinted at intimate relationship between the US constitution and its underlying custom 
16. Not clear that the federal government should be able to just import the common law int its understanding of its own enumerated powers 
17. Some argue that the Constitution really is just the result of common law, immemorial 
18. There have been cases where someone has not be charged, because they cannot be charged of a federal crime without there being a statute that expressly makes what they did illegal 
19. Common law and other factors, like Blackstone, should only have been used as examples or guides to what the law had been, not what they continued to be
20. Common law was abandoned when polities where law was supposed to be the product of contemporaneous consent, because it was technically inconsistent with America's political experiment 
21. In other cases, it was presented as natural or prepolitical, meaning its advent was more of a discovery rather than a creation 
22. Common law has the advantage of experience; people have lived basedon it and according to it, therefore it has that advantage compared to other institutions
23. This is based on the argument that all customs stem from voluntary adoption and therefore consent
24. Spooner argued that natural law was something that would ultimately prevail, despite man made law potentially going against it 
Scalia: 
1. Offers a critique of the common law method
2. The main problem he brings up is that the Common Law, while great in theory, is problematic in practice because of how it interacts with democracy
3. Specifically, the common law judge will adopt the mindset of trying to find the best possible outcome in every case, which may create inconsistencies between cases and thus destroy the stability and legitimacy of law, which was one of the main draws of the common law in the first place
4. One of the main things that judges have to do within the Common Law is to make distinctions between cases; i.e. why should this apply in one case but not the other 
5. Judges are no longer the agents of the king, because there are no kings
6. As a result, what essentially has happened is that judges make the common law and that each state has its own
7. however, judge made law is ex post facto, therefore unjust
8. There is no intelligible theory of interpretation, i.e. no one has defined the answer to how it's meant to happen
9. Goes over his interpretation of textualism, where texts are read in a reasonable manner, thus ignoring some of the excess meaning but not in an overly restrictive manner ideally
10. Textual interpretation also includes the usage of certain presumptions and rules of construction that load the dice for or against a particular result
11. Hard to present a uniform answer to a question with these rules in place
12. Usage of legislative history - permissible or no? 
13. We look heavily at what is supposedly original intention and other factors similar to that - is that permissible/should we? 
14. Argues that the constitution requires an expansive rather than narrow interpretation, although without going too far and therefore violating the limits of the text
15. Has concerns that judges don't even look at the original text and go straight towards what they believe to be a desirable outcome
16. Argues that the living Constitution idea works so long as it is meant to remove restrictions against democratic government, meaning we give people more power and more ability to make their own decisions
Schauer: 
1. Forward looking aspect: traditional perspective on precedent has focused on the use of yesterday's precedents in today's decisions
2. However, precedent is important in that we should look at today's precedents as tomorrow's precedents as well - any decision made today will most likely be used later down the road as well
3. Passage of time complicates things: we will continuously reinterpret the past as we proceed into the future; thus, we keep discussing yesterday's decisions
4. Only precedents of the past stand before us clothed with generations of characterizations and recharacterizations 
5. Argument from experience does not need to be based off the experience of the current decision maker - it can be based of someone else's decision or train of logic
6. Must presume that past institutions of decision makers are more or less equal with today's institutions, meaning their reasoning and decisions can be used for the current situation
7. Rules of relevance
	1. No two events are alike; however, with that said, this goes back to what Scalia wrote about the distinctions 
	2. What the common law judge does with precedents is to determine whether a past one should be applied in this case as well, and to distinguish the two if it is necessary
	3. Rule of relevance also can be used to explain a choice: for instance, how someone is characterized may be changed due to which relationship is most meaningful to the situation
	4. Sometime cases will explain exactly its reasons and the case's on limits - that's a nice way to look at it where it eliminates future speculation and largely makes this an easier way of understanding
	5. Some characterizations are more important than others; for example, associating a red bike with other bikes than with red ties or red meat
	6. Some of these distinctions are made out of ease and because it would be easier to go about our lives if we had used that 
	7. Not the case that reliance on precedent collapses into reliance on substantive normative rules - that simply is not the case
8. Price of precedent 
9. Precedent thus far has been argued to matter
10. What are its consequences
11. Rule of precedent, and therefore the common law system, tells a current decision maker to follow the decision in a previous similar case
12. Part of the concern would then be that current decision makers worry too much about how their decisions will be used in the future, which therefore leads to potential issues when it comes to how effective the current decisions actually are
13. case optimization no longer is as possible and is heavily limited 
14. Question of weight 
15. If the conclusions of one case apply to a sweeping broad set of analogies, then the constraints of precedent are likely to be substantial 
16. Precedent might provide one reason for a particular decision without providing a conclusive reason 
17. Some cases have an obligation, when it comes to understanding them properly, for example a higher requirement of understanding than otherwise 
18. Constraints of precedent attach in those instances where some set of events is deemed to be similar enough to a previous set of events
19. Why should their be constraints on precedent 
20. For fairness? Treat like cases alike; creates a sense of consistency and does not betray ideas that have previously been established
21. avoid arbitrariness and consequently unjust or unfair decisions
22. Predictability; we know what to expect, and there is no whiplash
23. gives us consistency and an ability to understand why something is going to happen before it even occurs
24. This does come with the caveat that predictability is appealing or something that we want to achieve
25. Really a question of balancing expected gain against expected loss 
26. Strengthened Decision-making
27. Makes it more efficient, i.e. there is less waiting and a court would hypothetically be able to make decisions faster - speedy trials and fast decisions are certainly desirable 
28. Consistency also increases the power of the decision making institution 
29. internal consistency strengthens external credibility 
30. Precedent and stability; arguments premised on the values of reliance, predictability, and decisional efficiency all share a focus on stability for stability's sake
31. This ties back to the Court and the judicial system in general being one that is somewhat conservative by nature and a little bit anti-progress
32. Precedent and the concept become less murky when we follow examples like these, as they force us to look at those settings where the constraints of precedent are largely absent 
Federalist: 
1. this is a novel undertaking, there are some who skimmed through it, basically looking for a problem with the Constitution so they could condemn it
2. Explains some of the difficulties, namely that common law and many other sources of law do not have a very clear idea of their boundaries 
Rakove - perils of originalism 
1. Madison did his best to preserve as much as he could when it came to materials from the Constitutional convention 
2. Meaning, intention, and understanding are three key terms here
3. Interpretation is done with the hope of recovering the original meaning of the Constitution 
4. Meaning must in at least some way be derived from usage; it is here that alternative formulations of original intention and understanding become pertinent 
5. Understanding can be used to cover the impressions and interpretations of the Constitution formed by its original readers and ratifiers 
6. The argument for originalism is that the original meaning, once it has been established, should be more than a point of departure and should be the binding rule of law and still governing of what should be done
7. What happens when there is no clear original meaning? 
8. A lot of the work that founders did was necessarily the really odd or nontangible theoretical questions; instead, it was more practical issues that actually truly mattered for their set of constituents 
9. The ratification effort was both well documented and also widespread obviously, there was a lot that went through people's minds as they debated whether to ratify the new constitution 
10. They provide good evidence in how the Constitution and its provisions were understood at the moment of adoption; how they understood it should be overly present within these ideas
11. We can also look at different sources that inspired the founders, like Hume 
12. However, not easy to link these together 
Hart: Sovereign and subject
1. Obedience is not free from complexities; typically suggest deference to authorities and not just compliance with orders backed by threats 
2. Both habit and obedience could b conceded to have an obvious application; however, when law is onerous it does not have the strong inclination of eventual compliance 
3. Not necessarily the case that just because a King was obeyed that their offspring would also be obeyed by the same subjects
4. This is because there is no habit of obedience to Rex II yet, as they have only just started to give orders 
5. While this in-between time can be dangerous, it does not mean that we haven't dealt with it
6. the consequences are generally obvious and avoided; for example, there is the idea of how sovereignty is haned down
7. I.e rex Ii has the title to succeed his father, and will have the right to make law on his father's death 
8. in both cases of social rules and habits, the behavior has to be general enough for it to be repeated when the occasion arises 
9. A habit only means that conduct converges; deviation from the regular course does not need to be criticized 
10. However, this is not enough to constitute the existence of a rule requiring that behavior 
11. Where there are rules, not only is there criticism when those rules are broken, deviation from the standard is accepted as good reason for making the rule in the first place
12. There is an internal aspect of rules
13. habit does not require much reflection, but a social rule does; someone must look at the behavior as a standard to be followed by the group as a whole
14. We need to notice that before a new legislator has even started to legislate, there is already a rule that dictates that he, or one of a class or line of persons is the one who will be able to do so
15. Acceptance of a rule at a given moment does not guarantee its continued existence 
16. For example, Rex I or II could lose the right to legislate at some point or another
17. Persistence of Law
18. Why is it that law made by people who have long since passed away remains law despite that
19. Legal limitations on legislative power? 
20. What stops the sovereign from making whatever law they want? 
21. The sovereign is in itself outside of the law, because if there was something that the sovereign was governed by, they would no longer be the sovereign
22. In some cases, it is possible that the Rex or sovereign is subject to limitations when it comes to what is truly legal and what isn't 
23. Thus, oversteps here would render the laws that were made illegitimate 
24. In a way, this is Constitutional 
25. First, legal limitations on legislative authority consist not of duties imposed on the legislator to obey some superior legislator but of disabilities contained in rules which qualify him to legislate 
26. We don't have to track law back to someone who is sovereign or unlimited, just to someone who can rightfully legislate 
27. We just have to show that the rules that qualify the legislator do not confer superior authority on those who also have authority over other territory 
28. Must distinguish between a legally unlimited legislative authority and one which, though limited, is supreme in the system 
29. legislator's habits of obedience are at the most of some indirect evidential importance 
Walzer: 
1. There are inherent difficulties to putting a king on trial: Namely, the king cannot be judged by anyone in he land because they are all his subjects and he answers to a higher power
2. Not law unto himself, but just not governed by terrestrial law
3. King can be a sinner and a tyrant, any accusation of tyranny would be very serious 
4. no political or legal content however, a king who had ruled tyrannically may not have violated any actual legal things
5. The tyrant may just be the monarch who is disliked
6. Main charge against kings who were brought to trial was treason, which is ironic seeing as the king is sort of the embodiment of the state
7. The argument that in some instances it may be legally permissible or required to assault or assassinate the sovereign, but that it would be impossible to charge them
8. Supposed contract of government - an agreement between the ruler and the people to govern in a particular manner? 
9. In france, there were two primary groups: the Girondins who wanted to create a special court of justice in order to put the king on trial, and then the Jacobins, who would have been satisfied with the execution of the king
10. The argument is partially that the King had become just a normal citizen and therefore could be brought to trial 
11. What had to be argued was that the King had been a king, had been recognized, and could be tried as a king
12. Gironde point of view is used in understanding how a king could be brought to trial in the first place
13. One lesson was that the king was a citizen, but that citizens had rights that could not be taken away even by the will of the people; in other words that there existed unalienable rights
14. Jacobin argument had advantage of taking royalist ideology and seriously and surrendering absolutely the fictions of royal citizenship and legal continuity that the Gironde wanted
15. Jacobins argued that the Gironde point of view was too soft basically, granted to concessions which therefore limited its ability to actually create change 
16. The mere outlawing of the king does not constitute the republic; does not tell us who the citizens of the republic are either
17. Higher right of a republic consists in the sovereignty of the people; a claim to legit authority has to come from somewhere
18. There's a difference between assassination and execution per Kant, the formal execution of the monarch is abominable, because of the the judicial process that implies restoration of any state would be impossible 
19. Thus, the murder of the inviolable sovereign makes it impossible to return to that state
20. A trial can be defended politically, but it may not follow that it is morally justified 
21. Revolutionary justice is defensible whenever it points the way to everyday justice; legitimacy of the king's trial first lies in whether it is similar to a ordinary judicial proceeding
Goodrich: 
1. How is the other construed in the legal sphere: how has the legal sphere refused to pay attention to it? 
2. Best depicted not in terms of law's own image, but rather in terms of the uneven exchange that characterizes the flawed dialogue of bureaucratic discourses
Caruth: Trauma: 
1. how does trauma force us to rethink our notions of experience and of communication 
2. trauma means that the event is not fully assimilated or experienced fully, but only belatedly or over time
3. Survivors uncertainty is not a simple amnesia, event returns insistently and against their will
4. This is the crisis of truth, trauma is, to a degree, an inability to experience something fully when it first happens
5. Trauma is not experienced as a mere repression or defense, but as a temporal delay that carries the individual beyond the shock of the first moment
Caruth: Recapturing the Past
1. Traumatic recollection is not just the recollection of a simple memory 
2. Trauma is something that is something thoroughly unconscious, as it may rear its head at any given moment
3. Truth of the event defies simple comprehension, and the flashback or traumatic reenactment conveys that it is both the truth of an event and the truth of its incomprehensibility 
4. Impossibility of a comprehensible story does not the denial of a transmissible truth, it just asks the question of how we may start with dealing with this impossibility 
Galanter: 
1. Injustice is pervasive: how do we deal with events that we recognize are in fact unjust? 
2. remedial justice inevitably disturbs existing expectations, addressing one prior injustice may create another one
3. Consumes resources, and remedies are administered by institutions that inevitably may create their own injustices
4. Different ways of understanding wrongs: 
5. Was it within a well defined time period? Or is a continued social practice? 
6. Single discrete event, or a series of events, long cumulative social process? 
7. Was it the doing of a specific agency or did it reflect a diffuse social process? 
8. Was it the manifestation of a deliberate policy or was it result of carelessness? 
9. What was the mora status? Violation of familiar norms? Acknowledgement that it was wrong? Claim of rightness that seemed self evident 
10. Are there identifiable and credible surrogates for the perpetrators for crimes of the past
11. Have those who were affected passed or can the direct impacts still be traced ancestrally? 
12. Why does it matter? 
13. How might it be done? 
14. How we address old wrongs tells us something about ourselves and the way we view our relation to history 
Minow: Breaking the Cycles of Hatred
1. Can we learn from past injustices and how they were addressed? 
2. Dwelling is unfortunate and potentially dangerous, but it is possible that forgetting altogether is worse 
3. Vengeance can just create an never ending cycle of misery
4. Trials can serve some purpose, but they can be challenging, subject to political limitations 
5. With that said, it can defy forced forgetting and can remind bystanders to take action rather than just letting something sit
6. Reparations create a bittersweet feeling - must be operated in a reasonable manner, otherwise it can lead to forgetting and does not necessarily fix anything and is just inauthentic 
7. Truth commissions that expose can also have their place, and can lead to reconciliation, but the barriers are so significant 
8. A lot of these fail because they do not provide the idea of closure; no response is singularly adequate and a multitude of responses is necessary in reality 
9. We can play a role in what we work to recall: fate of our fate is in our hands
10. We have a challenge to remember injustices and to resolve them
11.
