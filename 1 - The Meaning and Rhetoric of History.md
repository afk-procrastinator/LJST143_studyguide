## [[White; “The Value of Narrativity in the Representation of Reality”.pdf]]

^6c8006

- centrality of narrative in culture, history, law
- outlines a few key ways of history: annals, chronicles, history proper
- concepts and issues of authority, subject, closure
	- generally, the *value* of narrativity! duh.
	- moral authority necessary to concluse the narrative
- historians themselves have given narrativity a value 
- examples:
	- annals of Saint Gall
	- Dino's Cronica as close to a modern history proper 
### key quote(s):
> I have sought to suggest that this value attached to narrativity in the representation of real events arises out of a desire to have real events display the coherence, integrity, fullness, and closure of an image of life that is and can only be imaginary. The notion that sequences of real events possess the formal attributes of the stories we tell about imaginary events could only have its origin in wishes, daydreams, reveries. Does the world really present itself to perception in the form of well-made stories, with central subjects, proper beginnings, middles, and ends, and a coherence that permits us to see "the end" in every beginning? Or does it present itself more in the forms that the annals and chronicle suggest, either as mere sequence without beginning or end or as sequences of beginnings that only terminate and never conclude? And does the world, even the social world, ever really come to us as already narrativized, already "speaking itself" from beyond the horizon of our capacity to make scientific sense of it?

## [[Palsgraf v Long Island Railroad Co.pdf]]

^1c39de

- supreme court case from 1928, decided in May
- disposition: judgement reversed 
- main opinion by cardozo
	- pound, lehman, and kellogg concur
	- andrews dissents with crane and o'brien
- the case which noonan discusses in [[Noonan; The Passengers of Palsgraf.pdf|passengers of palsgraf]]
- facts: lady was on a platform on a railroad, someone running to catch a train dropped their package, package went boom boom, part of the roof tiles fell and hit the plaintiff 
	- very cold, disconnected, doesn't even discuss the gender: further discussed with noonan
- `Plaintiff failed to establish that her injuries were caused by negligence of the defendant and it was error for the court to deny the defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint`
### majority opinion: 
- all about negligence and awareness of said negligence: `Negligence is the absence of care, according to the circumstances` - 2
> Negligence is not actionable unless it involves the invasion of a legally protected interest, the violation of a right. “Proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do” - 3
> If no hazard was apparent to the eye of ordinary vigilance, an act innocent and harmless, at least to outward seeming, with reference to her, did not take to itself the quality of a tort because it happened to be a wrong, though apparently not one involving the risk of bodily insecurity, with reference to some one else. - 3
- addresses the concept of tort law itself
- and what defines a *wrong*
> What the plaintiff must show is “a wrong” to herself, i. e., a violation of her own right, and not merely a wrong to some one else, nor conduct “wrongful” because unsocial, but not “a wrong” to any one. - 4
> Liability can be no greater where the act is inadvertent. - 4
- and key quote imo: 
> Negligence, like risk, is thus a term of relation. Negligence in the abstract, apart from things related, is surely not a tort, if indeed it is understandable at all. Negligence is not a tort unless it results in the commission of a wrong, and the commission of a wrong imports the violation of a right, in this case, we are told, the right to be protected against interference with one’s bodily security. But bodily security is protected, not against all forms of interference or aggression, but only against some.
- all based off of that concept of *wrong* -- in order to choose/look at consequences, they must first be rooted in a wrong!
### dissent by andrews:
- andrews argues there *is* a direct connection, proximate cause: 
> We are told by the appellant in his brief “it cannot be denied that the explosion was the direct cause of the plaintiffs injuries.” So it was a substantial factor in producing the result -- there was here a natural and continuous sequence -- direct connection. - 8
- wants the court to look at "cause and effect"
- key quote: 
> It is all a question of expediency. There are no fixed rules to govern our judgment. There are simply matters of which we may take account. We have in a somewhat different connection spoken of “the stream of events.” We have asked whether that stream was deflected -- whether it was forced into new and unexpected channels. (Donnelly v. Piercy Contracting Co., 222 N. Y. 210). This is rather rhetoric than law. There is in truth little to guide us other than common sense. - 7

## [[Noonan; The Passengers of Palsgraf.pdf]]

^f0b3c8

- basically, a narrativization of the palsgraf case
- looks more at the context of the case and the decisions
	- as well as the history of the case's history — such as cardozo's bias, connections, etc. 
- claims the case to be the "most famous tort case of modern times"
- also gives more "life" to the actual players of the case, especially the plaintiff 
- case was only paid attention to in hindsight, a while after
	- over *time* people began to "fill out" the case itself in that they discovered new facts, etc. (?)
> Out of a sequence of events as improbable as a Rube Goldberg cartoon, reconstructed by lawyers seeking partisan advantage, on a factual basis that was probably inaccurate, above the pain of Helen Palsgraf and the plodding of Matthew Wood and the calculation of the Long Island, Cardozo fashioned a statement of clarity, symmetry, simplicity. Presented with that pervasive problem of sociology, government, and law, the "unintended consequences" of a social action, he imposed order and aesthetic design and generality. - 41
## [[Ferguson; “Rhetorics of the Judicial Opinion”.pdf]]

^f81798

- looking at the language used within court opinions 
	- a tendency for similarities in "method, theme, and approach"
		- but thinks that there is a need to do the opposite
	- particularly:
> Circumstance, ideological difference, institutional authority, public disagreement, and political explosiveness combine to make language especially memorable. - 3
- looks at a handful of cases and concepts throughout:
	- Minersville School District vs Gobitis and West Virginia State Board of Education vs Barnette are key cases
- ideas explored:
	- the monologic voice
		- *who* exactly is speaking, who has the right to: 
		- > `Well beyond ceremony, however, there is a peculiar dynamic of voice in the judicial opinion, and the first impulse in the genre of the judicial opinion has to do with this peculiarity: the speaking judge in the act of judgment and after is profoundly monologic in voice and ideological thrust.`
		- > `The goal of judgement is to subsume difference in an act or explanation and a moment of decision`
		- a self-dramatizing (narrativizing?) moment 
		- reassures the reader of the writer's authority and power 
			- acceptance from reader requires an "appraisal of character beyond narrative"
		- the judge never seems to have a choice, they must act as if it is forced
			- address as if they were "speaking" for the law 
		- >` Judicial formalism is not just a legal philosophy that can be put aside or an intellectual residue of the history of ideas. It is an innate psychological impulse at work in the occasion of judicial performance and, hence, in the record of performance, the genre of the judicial opinion.`
	- the interrogative mode 
		- the question judges decide to take up
			- questions shape our knowledge more than the theories 
		- similarly related to the monologic voice in that it helps make the reader identify, solidifies power in the judge 
	- the declarative tone 
		- >`If the courtroom opinion as literary genre is rooted in the interrogative mode, it is driven by a declarative tone. The only sincere questions in judicial opinions-sincere in the sense that they ask for answers beyond the ken of the interrogator-appear in dissents.`
		- judgement must reduce event -> incident -> narrative = judgement 
		- really another way of securing power!
		- >`The language of affirmation in the judicial opinion is encompassing and inclusive. The distanced zone of judicial language instinctively brings ev- eryone under its umbrella. Hyperbole, certitude, assertion, simplification, and abstraction are the essential tools of the declarative tone as it reaches down from above in a way that can be accepted from below. No signifi- cant Supreme Court decision is without them.`
	- the rhetoric of inevitability 
		- what everything above builds to! 
			- arrive to inevitability by "seeing present or future things in terms of the past"
			- such as precedent 
		- looking to the past in order to help explain the present
		- delivering an opinion is also building a history — keepers of the past, safeguarding the present
		- >`That the past controls the present in this discovery of the norm is a given. What was and what is come together in the ruling expectation of what must be.`
		- BUT: history can be manipulated, so it's difficult 
		- overall, judges want to create a continuity within law — that's their intire point
		- and this rhetoric also solidifies power and obedience 
		- >`The ultimate task of the judi- cial decision is to transform common understanding into a tie that will, in fact, bind. More often than not, that tie comes through a presentation of history commonly understood and, because understood, accepted.`
- concluding paragraph is worth pasting: 
> Hence,  more  important  than  speculations  about  change  is  a  more scrupulous  attention  to  language  itself.  We  need  a  better  understanding  of the  complex  and  often  contradictory  workings  of  judicial  discourse:  how judges  work  within  barely  acknowledged  constraints  that  they  also  shape; how  courts  construe  a  shared  genre  from  different  venues  and  levels  in  the judicial  hierarchy;  how  rhetoric  and  dogma  conspire  under  pressure. Many  tools  of  understanding  apply  here,  but  attention  to  language  is  the key.  "Books,"  writes  Henry  Thoreau,  "must  be  read  as  deliberately  and reservedly  as  they  were  written. '""  The judicial  opinion  deserves  the  same injunction.  Judges  use  words  to  secure  shared  explanations  and  identifications;  they  also  use  them  as  weapons  of  control.  Deliberation  with  reservation  explores  that  distinction,  and  the  result  is  more  than  understanding. Here  and  elsewhere,  a  practiced  appreciation  or  resourcefulness  in  language  is  the  first  safeguard  in  a  republic  of  laws.
